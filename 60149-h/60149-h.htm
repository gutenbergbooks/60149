<p>Bright and joyous was the aspect of nature on a
spring morning in the beautiful county of Somersetshire.
The budding green on the trees was yet so
light, that, like a transparent veil, it showed the outlines
of every twig; but on the lowlier hedges it lay
like a rich mantle of foliage, and clusters of primroses
nestled below, while the air was perfumed with
violets. Already was heard the hum of some adventurous
bee in search of early sweets, the distant low
of cattle from the pasture, the mellow note of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
cuckoo from the grove,—every sight and sound told
of enjoyment on that sunny Sabbath morn.</p>

<p>Yet let me make an exception. There was one
spot which reserved to itself the unenviable privilege
of looking gloomy all the year round. Nettleby
Tower, a venerable edifice, stood on the highest summit
of a hill, like some stern guardian of the fair
country that smiled around it. The tower had been
raised in the time of the Normans, and had then
been the robber-hold of a succession of fierce barons,
who, from their strong position, had defied the power
of king or law. The iron age had passed away.
The moat had been dried, and the useless portcullis
had rusted over the gate. The loop-holes, whence
archers had pointed their shafts, were half filled up
with the rubbish accumulated by time. Lichens had
mantled the grey stone till its original hue was almost
undistinguishable; silent and deserted was the courtyard
which had so often echoed to the clatter of
hoofs, or the ringing clank of armour.</p>

<p>Silent and deserted—yes! It was not time alone
that had wrought the desolation. Nettleby Tower
had stood a siege in the time of the Commonwealth,
and the marks of bullets might still be traced on its
walls; but the injuries which had been inflicted by
the slow march of centuries, or the more rapid visitation
of war, were slight compared to those which had
been wrought by litigation and family dissension.
The property had been for years the subject of a <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>vexatious
lawsuit, which had half ruined the unsuccessful
party, and the present owner of Nettleby Tower had
not cared to take personal possession of the gloomy
pile. Perhaps Mr. Auger knew that the feeling of
the neighbourhood would be against him, as the
sympathies of all would be enlisted on the side of
the descendant of that ancient family which had for
centuries dwelt in the Tower, who had been deprived
of his birthright by the will of a proud and intemperate
father.</p>

<p>The old fortress had thus been suffered to fall into
decay. Grass grew in the courtyard; the wallflower
clung to the battlements; the winter snow and the
summer rain made their way through the broken
casements, and no hand had removed the mass of
wreck which lay where a furious storm had thrown
down one of the ancient chimneys. Parties of tourists
occasionally visited the gloomy place, trod the long,
dreary corridors, and heard from a wrinkled woman
accounts of the moth-eaten tapestry, and the time-darkened
family portraits that grimly frowned from
the walls. They heard tales of the last Mr. Bardon,
the proud owner of the pile; how he had been wont
to sit long and late over his bottle, carousing with
jovial companions, till the hall resounded with their
oaths and their songs; and how, more than thirty
years back, he had disinherited his only son for
marrying a farmer’s daughter. Then the old woman
would, after slowly showing the way up the worn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
stone steps which led round and round till they
opened on the summit of the tower, direct her
listener’s attention to a small grey speck in the wide-spreading
landscape below, and tell them that Dr.
Bardon lived there in needy circumstances, in actual
sight of the place where, if every man had his right,
he would now be dwelling as his fathers had dwelt.
And the visitors would sigh, shake their heads, and
moralize on the strange changes in human fortunes.</p>

<p>The old woman who showed strangers over
Nettleby Tower lived in a cottage hard by; neither
she nor any other person was ever to be found in the
old halls after the sun had set. The place had the
repute of being haunted, and was left after dark to
the sole possession of the rooks, the owls, and the
bats. I must tax the faith of my readers to believe
that the old tower <em>was</em> actually haunted; not by
the ghosts of the dead, but by the spirits of evil that
are ever moving amongst the living. I must attempt
with a bold hand to draw aside the mysterious
veil which divides the invisible from the visible world,
and though I must invoke imagination to my aid, it
is imagination fluttering on the confines of truth.
Bear with me, then, while I personify the spirits of
Pride and Intemperance, and represent them as
lingering yet in the pile in which for centuries they
had borne sway over human hearts.</p>

<p>Standing on the battlements of the grey tower,
behold two dim, but gigantic forms, like dark clouds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
that to the eye of fancy have assumed a mortal
shape. The little rock-plant that has found a
cradle between the crumbling stones bends not
beneath their weight,—and yet how many deep-rooted
hopes have they crushed! Their unsubstantial
shapes cast no shadow on the wall, and yet have
darkened myriads of homes! The natural sense
cannot recognise their presence; the eye beholds them
not, the human ear cannot catch the low thunder of
their speech; and yet there they stand, terrible
<em>realities</em>,—known, like the invisible plague, by their
effects upon those whom they destroy!</p>

<p>There is a wild light in the eyes of Intemperance,
not caught from the glad sunbeams that are bathing
the world in glory; it is like a red meteor playing
over some deep morass, and though there is often
mirth in his tone, it is such mirth as jars upon the
shuddering soul like the laugh of a raving maniac!
Pride is of more lofty stature than his companion,
perhaps of yet darker hue, and his voice is lower and
deeper. His features are stamped with the impress
of all that piety abhors and conscience shrinks from,
for we behold him without his veil. Human infirmity
may devise soft names for cherished sins, and
even invest them with a specious glory which deceives
the dazzled eye; but who could endure to see
in all their bare deformity those two arch soul-destroyers,
Intemperance and Pride?</p>

<p>“Nay, it was I who wrought this ruin!” exclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
the former, stretching his shadowy hand over the
desolated dwelling. “Think you that had Hugh
Bardon possessed his senses unclouded by my spell, he
would ever have driven forth from his home his own—his
only son?”</p>

<p>“Was it not I,” replied Pride, “who ever stood
beside him, counting up the long line of his ancestry,
inflaming his soul with legends of the past, making
him look upon his own blood as something different
from that which flows in the veins of ordinary mortals,
till he learned to regard a union with one of lower
rank as a crime beyond forgiveness?”</p>

<p>“I,” cried Intemperance, “intoxicated his brain”—</p>

<p>“I,” interrupted Pride, “intoxicated his spirit.
You fill your deep cup with fermented beverage; the
fermentation which I cause is within the soul, and
it varies according to the different natures that receive
it. There is the <em>vinous</em> fermentation, that
which man calls high spirit, and the world hails with
applause, whether it sparkle up into courage, or
effervesce into hasty resentment. There is the <em>acid</em>
fermentation; the sourness of a spirit brooding over
wrongs and disappointments, irritated against its
fellow-man, and regarding his acts with suspicion.
This the world views with a kind of compassionate
scorn, or perhaps tolerates as something that may
occasionally correct the insipidity of social intercourse.
And there is the third, the last stage of fermentation,
when hating and hated of all, wrapt up in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
his own self-worship, and poisoning the atmosphere
around with the exhalations of rebellion and unbelief,
my slave becomes, even to his fellow-bondsmen, an
object of aversion and disgust. Such was my power
over the spirit of Hugh Bardon. I quenched the
parent’s yearning over his son; I kept watch even
by his bed of death; and when holy words of warning
were spoken, I made him turn a deaf ear to the
charmer, and hardened his soul to destruction!”</p>

<p>“I yield this point to you,” said Intemperance,
“I grant that your black badge was rivetted on the
miserable Bardon even more firmly than mine. And
yet, what are your scattered conquests to those which
I hourly achieve! Do I not drive my thousands and
tens of thousands down the steep descent of folly,
misery, disgrace, till they perish in the gulf of ruin?
Count the gin-palaces dedicated to me in this professedly
Christian land; are they not crowded with
my victims? Who can boast a power to injure that
is to be compared to mine?”</p>

<p>“Your power is great,” replied Pride, “but it is a
power that has limits, nay, limits that become narrower
and narrower as civilization and religion gain
ground. You have been driven from many a stately
abode, where once Intemperance was a welcome guest,
and have to cower amongst the lowest of the low,
and seek your slaves amongst the vilest of the vile.
Seest thou yon church,” continued Pride, pointing to
the spire of a small, but beautiful edifice, embowered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
amongst elms and beeches; “hast thou ever dared
so much as to touch one clod of the turf on which
falls the shadow of that building?”</p>

<p>“It is, as you well know, forbidden ground,” replied
Intemperance.</p>

<p>“To you—to you, but not to me!” exclaimed
Pride, his form dilating with exultation. “I enter
it unseen with the worshippers, my voice blends with
the hymn of praise; nay, I sometimes mount the
pulpit with the preacher,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and while a rapt audience
hang upon his words, infuse my secret poison into
his soul! When offerings are collected for the poor,
how much of the silver and the gold is tarnished and
tainted by my breath! The very monuments raised
to the dead often bear the print of my touch; I fix
the escutcheon, write the false epitaph, and hang my
banner boldly even over the Christian’s tomb!”</p>

<p>“Your power also has limits,” quoth Intemperance.
“There is an antidote in the inspired Book
for every poison that you can instil.”</p>

<p>“I know it, I know it,” exclaimed Pride, “and
marks it not the extent of my influence and the
depth of the deceptions that I practise, that against
no spirit, except that of Idolatry, are so many warnings
given in that Book as against the spirit of Pride?
For every denunciation against Intemperance, how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
many may be found against me! Not only religion
and morality are your mortal opponents, but self-interest
and self-respect unite to weaken the might
of Intemperance; <em>I</em> have but one foe that I fear, one
that singles me out for conflict! As David with his
sling to Goliath, so to Pride is the Spirit of the
Gospel!”</p>

<p>“How is it, then,” inquired Intemperance, “that
so many believers in the Gospel fall under your sway?”</p>

<p>“It is because I have so many arts, such subtle
devices, I can change myself into so many different
shapes; I steal in so softly that I waken not the
sentinel Conscience to give an alarm to the soul! <em>You</em>
throw one broad net into the sea where you see a shoal
within your reach; <em>I</em> angle for my prey with skill,
hiding my hook with the bait most suited to the
taste of each of my victims. <em>You</em> pursue your quarry
openly before man; <em>I</em> dig the deep hidden pit-fall
for mine. <em>You</em> disgust even those whom you enslave;
<em>I</em> assume forms that rather please than offend.
Sometimes I am ‘a pardonable weakness,’ sometimes
‘a natural instinct,’ sometimes,” and here Pride curled
his lip with a mocking smile, “I am welcomed as
a generous virtue!”</p>

<p>“It is in this shape,” said Intemperance angrily,
“that you have sometimes even taken a part against
me! You have taught my slaves to despise and
break from my yoke!”</p>

<p>“Pass over that,” replied Pride; “or balance against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
it the many times when I have done you a service,
encouraging men to be <em>mighty to mingle strong
drink</em>.”</p>

<p>“Nay, you must acknowledge,” said Intemperance,
“that we now seldom work together.”</p>

<p>“We have different spheres,” answered Pride.
“You keep multitudes from ever even attempting
to enter the fold; I put my manacles upon tens of
thousands who deem that they already have entered.
I doubt whether there be one goodly dwelling
amongst all those that dot yonder wide prospect,
where one, if not all of the inmates, wears not my
invisible band round the arm.”</p>

<p>“You will except the pastor’s, at least,” said Intemperance.
“Yonder, on the path that leads to
the school, I see his gentle daughter. She has
warned many against me; and with her words, her
persuasions, her prayers, has driven me from more
than one home. I shrink from the glance of that
soft, dark eye, as if it carried the power of Ithuriel’s
spear. Ida seems to me to be purity itself; upon
her, at least, you can have no hold.”</p>

<p>“Were we nearer,” laughed the malignant spirit,
“you would see my dark badge on the saint! Since
her childhood I have been striving and struggling
to make Ida Aumerle my own. Sometimes she has
snapped my chain, and I am ofttimes in fear that
she will break away from my bondage for ever.
But methinks I have a firm hold over her now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>“Her pride must be spiritual pride,” observed
Intemperance.</p>

<p>“Not so,” replied his evil companion; “I tried
that spell, but my efforts failed. While with sweet
voice and winning persuasion Ida is now guiding
her class to Truth, and warning her little flock
against us both, would you wish to hearken to the
story of the maiden, and hear all that I have done
to win entrance into a heart which the grace of God
has cleansed?”</p>

<p>“Tell me her history,” said Intemperance; “she
seems to me like the snowdrop that lifts its head
above the sod, pure as a flake from the skies.”</p>

<p>“Even the snowdrop has its roots in the earth,”
was the sardonic answer of Pride.</p>

<p>“Ida Aumerle,” began the dark narrator, “at the
age of twelve had the misfortune to lose her mother,
and was left, with a sister several years younger
than herself, to the sole care of a tender and indulgent
father. Ever on the watch to strengthen my interests
amongst the children of men, I sounded the
dispositions of the sisters, to know what chance I
possessed of making them prisoners of Pride. Mabel,
clever, impulsive, fearless in character, with a mind
ready to receive every impression, and a spirit full
of energy and emulation, I knew to be one who was
likely readily to come under the power of my spell.
Ida was less easily won; she was a more thoughtful,
contemplative girl, her temper was less quick, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
passions were less easily roused, and I long doubted
where lay the weak point of character on which
Pride might successfully work.</p>

<p>“As Ida grew towards womanhood my doubts
were gradually dispelled. I marked that the fair
maiden loved to linger opposite the mirror which
reflected her tall, slight, graceful form, and that the
gazelle eyes rested upon it with secret satisfaction.
There was much time given to braiding the hair and
adorning the person; and the fashion of a dress, the
tint of a ribbon, became a subject for grave consideration.
There are thousands of girls enslaved by
the pride of beauty with far less cause than Ida
Aumerle.”</p>

<p>“But this folly,” observed Intemperance, “was
likely to give you but temporary power. Beauty is
merely skin-deep, and passes away like a flower!”</p>

<p>“But often leaves the pride of it behind,” replied
his companion. “There is many a wrinkled woman
who can never forget that she once was fair,—nay,
who seems fondly to imagine that she can never
cease to be fair; and who makes herself the laughing-stock
of the world by assuming in age the attire
and graces of youth. It will never be thus with
Ida Aumerle.</p>

<p>“I thought that my chain was firmly fixed upon
her, when one evening I found it suddenly torn
from her wrist, and trampled beneath her feet! The
household at the Vicarage had retired to rest; Ida<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
had received her father’s nightly blessing, and was
sitting alone in her own little room. The lamp-light
fell upon a form and face that might have been
thought to excuse some pride, but Ida’s reflections
at that moment had nothing in common with me.
She was bending eagerly over that Book which condemns,
and would destroy me,—a book which she
had ofttimes perused before, but never with the
earnest devotion which was then swelling her heart.
Her hands were clasped, her dark eyes swimming
in joyful tears, and her lips sometimes moved in
prayer,—not cold, formal prayer, such as I myself
might prompt, but the outpouring of a spirit overflowing
with grateful love. That was the birthday
of a soul! I stood gloomily apart; I dared not
approach one first conscious of her immortal destiny,
first communing in spirit with her God!”</p>

<p>“You gave up your designs, then, in despair?”</p>

<p>“You would have done so,” answered Pride with
haughtiness; “I do not despair, I only delay. I
found that pride of beauty had indeed given way to
a nobler, more exalting feeling. Ida had drunk at
the fountain of purity, and the petty rill of personal
vanity had become to her insipid and distasteful.
She was putting away the childish things which
amuse the frivolous soul. Ida’s time was now too
well filled up with a succession of pious and charitable
occupations, to leave a superfluous share to the
toilette. The maiden’s dress became simple, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
the luxury which she now esteemed was that of
assisting the needy. Many of her trinkets were
laid aside, not because she deemed it a sin to wear
them, but because her mind was engrossed by higher
things. One whose first object and desire is to please
a heavenly Master by performing angels’ offices
below, is hardly likely to dwell much on the consideration
that her face and her figure are comely.”</p>

<p>“Ida is, I know, reckoned a model of every
feminine virtue,” said Intemperance. “I can conceive
that your grand design was now to make her
think herself as perfect as all the rest of the world
thought her.”</p>

<p>“Ay, ay; to involve her in spiritual pride! But
the maiden was too much on her knees, examined
her own heart too closely, tried herself by too lofty
a standard for that. When the faintest shadow of
that temptation fell upon her, she started as though
she had seen the viper lurking under the flowers,
and cast it from her with abhorrence! ‘A sinner,
a weak, helpless sinner, saved only by the mercy,
trusting only in the strength of a higher power;’
this Ida Aumerle not only calls herself, but actually
feels herself to be. The power of Grace in her heart
is too strong on that point for Pride.”</p>

<p>“And yet you hope to subject her to your sway?</p>

<p>“About two years after the night which I have
mentioned,” resumed Pride, “after Ida had attained
the age of eighteen, she resided for some time at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Aspendale, the home of her uncle, Augustine Aumerle.”</p>

<p>“One of your prisoners?” inquired Intemperance.</p>

<p>“Of him anon,” replied the dark one, “our present
subject is his niece. At his dwelling Ida met with
one who had been Augustine’s college companion,
Reginald, Earl of Dashleigh. You can just discern
the towers of his mansion faint in the blue distance
yonder.”</p>

<p>“I know it,” replied Intemperance; “I frequented
the place in his grandfather’s time. The
present earl, as I understand, is your votary rather
than mine.”</p>

<p>“Puffed up with pride of rank,” said the stern
spirit; “but pride of rank could not withstand a
stronger passion, or prevent him from laying his fortune
and title at the feet of Ida Aumerle.”</p>

<p>“An opportunity for you!” suggested Intemperance.</p>

<p>“A golden opportunity I deemed it. What
woman is not dazzled by a coronet? what girl is insensible
to the flattering attentions of him who owns
one, even if he possess no other recommendation,
which, with Dashleigh, is far from being the case?
There was a struggle in the mind of Ida. I whispered
to her of all those gilded baubles for which
numbers have eagerly bartered happiness here, and
forfeited happiness hereafter. I set before her grand
images of earthly greatness, the pomp and trappings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
of state, the homage paid by the world to station.
I strove to inflame her mind with ambition. But
here Ida sought counsel of the All-wise, and she saw
through my glittering snare. The earl, though of
character unblemished in the eyes of man, and far
from indifferent to religion, is not one whom a heaven-bound
pilgrim like Ida would choose as a companion
for life. Dashleigh’s spirit is too much clogged with
earth; he is too much divided in his service; he
wears too openly my chain, as if he deemed it an
ornament or distinction. Ida prayed, reflected, and
then resolved. She declined the addresses of her
uncle’s guest, and returned home at once to her
father.”</p>

<p>“The wound which she inflicted was not a deep
one,” remarked Intemperance. “Dashleigh was
speedily consoled, without even seeking comfort from
me.”</p>

<p>“I poisoned his wound,” exclaimed Pride, “and
drove him to seek instant cure. Dashleigh’s rejection
aroused in his breast as much indignation as
grief; and I made the disappointed and irritated man
at once offer his hand to one who was not likely
to decline it, Annabella, the young cousin of Ida.”</p>

<p>“And what said the high-souled Ida to the sudden
change in the object of his devotion?”</p>

<p>“I breathed in her ear,” answered Pride, “the
suggestion, ‘He might have waited a little longer.’
I called up a flush to the maiden’s cheek when she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
received tidings of the hasty engagement. But still
I met with little but repulse. With maidenly reserve
Ida concealed even from her own family a secret
which pride might have led her to reveal, and
none more affectionately congratulated the young
countess on her engagement, than she who might
have worn the honours which now devolved upon
another.”</p>

<p>“Ida Aumerle appears to be gifted with such a
power of resisting your influence and repelling your
temptations, that I can scarcely imagine,” quoth Intemperance,
“upon what you can ground your assurance
that you hold her captive at length. Pride
of beauty, pride of conquest, pride of ambition, she
has subdued; to spiritual pride she never has yielded.
What dart remains in your quiver when so many
have swerved from the mark?”</p>

<p>“Or rather, have fallen blunted from the shield of
faith,” gloomily interrupted Pride. “Ida’s real danger
began when she thought the dart too feeble to
render it needful to lift the shield against it.
Ida, on her return home, found her father on the
point of contracting a second marriage with a lady
who had been one of his principal assistants in arranging
and keeping in order the machinery of his
parish. Miss Lambert, by her activity and energy,
seemed a most fitting help-meet for a pastor. She
was Aumerle’s equal in fortune and birth, and not
many years his junior in age. She had been always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
on good terms with his family, and the connection
appeared one of the most suitable that under the
circumstances could have been formed. And so
it might have proved,” continued Pride, “but for
me!”</p>

<p>“Is Mrs. Aumerle, then, under your control?”</p>

<p>“She is somewhat proud of her good management,
of her clear common sense, of her knowledge
of the world,” was the dark one’s reply; “and this
is one cause of the coldness between her and the
daughters of her husband. Ida, from childhood, had
been accustomed to govern her own actions and
direct her own pursuits. Steady and persevering
in character, she had not only pursued a course of
education by herself, but had superintended that of
her more impetuous sister. Since her mother’s
death Ida had been subject to no sensible control,
for her father looked upon her as perfection, and left
her a degree of freedom which to most girls might
have been highly dangerous. Thus her spirit had
become more independent, and her opinions more
formed than is usual in those of her age. On her
father’s marriage Ida found herself dethroned from
the position which she so long had held. She was
second where she had been first,—second in the
house, second in the parish, second in the affections
of a parent whom she almost idolatrously loved. I
saw that the moment had come for inflicting a pang;
you will believe that the opportunity was not trifled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
away! Ida had been accustomed to lead rather
than to follow. She exercised almost boundless influence
over her sister Mabel, and was regarded as
an oracle by the poor. Another was now taking
her place, and another whose views on many subjects
materially differed from her own, who saw various
duties in a different light, and whose character disposed
her to act in petty matters the part of a zealous
reformer. I marked Ida’s annoyance at changes
proposed, improvements resolved on, and I silently
pushed my advantage. I have now placed Ida in
the position of an independent state, armed to resist
encroachments from, and owning no allegiance to a
powerful neighbour. There is indeed no open war;
decency, piety, and regard for the feelings of a husband
and father alike forbid all approach to that;
but there is secret, ceaseless, determined opposition.
I never suffer Ida to forget that her own tastes are
more refined, her ideas more elevated than those of
her step-mother; and I will not let her perceive that
in many of the affairs of domestic life, Mrs. Aumerle,
as she had wider experience, has also clearer judgment
than herself. I represent advice from a step-mother
as interference, reproof from a step-mother
as persecution, and draw Ida to seek a sphere of her
own as distinct as possible from that of the woman
whom her father has chosen for his wife.”</p>

<p>“Doubtless you occasionally remind the fair
maid,” suggested Intemperance, “that but for her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
own heroic unworldliness she might have been a
peeress of the realm.”</p>

<p>“I neglect nothing,” answered Pride, “that can
serve to elevate the spirit of one whom I seek to
enslave. I have need of caution and reserve, though
hitherto I have met with success, for it is no easy
task thoroughly to blind a conscience once enlightened
like that of Ida. She does even now in hours of
self-examination reproach herself for a feeling towards
Mrs. Aumerle which almost approaches dislike.
She feels that her own peace is disturbed; for the
lightest breath of sin can cloud the bright mirror
of such a soul. But in such hours I hover near.
I draw the penitent’s attention from her own faults
to those of the woman she loves not, till I make her
pity herself where she should blame, and account the
burden which <em>I</em> have laid upon her as a cross appointed
by Heaven.”</p>

<p>“O Pride, Pride!” exclaimed Intemperance with
a burst of admiration, “I am a child in artifice
compared with you!”</p>

<p>“Rest assured that when any young mortal is disposed
to look down upon one placed above her by the
will of a higher power, that pride is lingering near.”</p>

<p>“And by what name may you be known in this particular
phase of your being?” inquired Intemperance.</p>

<p>“The pride of self-will in the language of truth;
but Ida would call me <em>sensitiveness</em>,” replied the
dark spirit with a gloomy smile.</p>

<p>“The pastor and his wife I see approaching the
church,” observed Intemperance, glancing down in
the direction of the path along which advanced a
rather stout lady, with large features and high complexion,
who was leaning on the arm of a tall, handsome,
but rather heavily-built man, in whose mild,
dark eyes might be traced a resemblance to those of
his daughter.</p>

<p>“They come early,” said Pride; “he, to prepare for
service; his wife, to hear the school children rehearse
the hymns appointed for the day. This was once
Ida’s weekly care; she is far more qualified for the
charge than her step-mother, and the music has
suffered from the change.”</p>

<p>“Ida showed humility, at least, in yielding up that
charge,” remarked Intemperance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>“Humility,” exclaimed Pride, an expression of
ineffable scorn convulsing his shadowy features as
the word was pronounced. “I should not marvel
if Ida thought so; but hear the real state of the
case. The maiden had taken extreme pains to teach
her choir a beautiful anthem, in which a trio is introduced,
which she instructed three of the girls who
had the finest voices and the most perfect taste to
sing. Mrs. Aumerle, on hearing the anthem, at once
condemned it. It was time wasted, she averred, to
teach cottage-children to sing like choristers in a
cathedral; and to make a whole congregation cease
singing in order to listen to the voices of three, was
to turn the heads of the girls, and make them fancy
themselves far above the homely duties of the state
in which Providence had been pleased to place them.
There was common sense in the observations; but
Ida saw in it simply want of taste, and at my suggestion,—<em>at
my suggestion</em>,” repeated Pride in triumph,
“she gave up charge of the music altogether, because
she was offended at any fault having been found in
it by one who knew so little of the subject.”</p>

<p>“Is the minister himself a good man?” inquired
Intemperance.</p>

<p>“Good! yes, good, if any of the worms of earth
can be called so,” replied Pride, with gloomy bitterness,
“for he does not regard himself as good.
Naturally weak and corrupt are the best of mortals,
prone to fall, and liable to sin, yet I succeed in persuading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
many that the gold which is intrusted to
their keeping imparts some intrinsic merit to the clay
vessel which contains it; that the cinder, glowing
bright from the fire which pervades it, is in itself a
brilliant and beautiful thing!”</p>

<p>“But Lawrence Aumerle was never your captive?”</p>

<p>“I thought once that he would be so,” replied
Pride, his features darkening at the recollection of
disappointment and failure. “Aumerle had been a
singularly prosperous man—his life had appeared one
uninterrupted course of success. Easy in circumstances,
cherished in his family, a favourite in society,
beloved by the poor, with a disposition easy and
tranquil, disturbed by no violent passion,—the lot of
Aumerle was one which might well render him a
subject of envy. In the pleasantness of that lot lay
its peril. Aumerle was not the first saint who in
prosperity has thought that he should never be
moved, who has been tempted to regard earthly
blessings as tokens of Heaven’s peculiar favour. He
knew little of the burden and heat of the day, still
less of the strife and the struggle. Self-satisfaction
was beginning to creep over his soul, as vegetation
mantles a standing pool over which the rough winds
never sweep. ‘He is mine!’ I thought, ‘mine
until death, and indolence and apathy shall soon add
their links to the chain forged by pride of prosperity.’
But mine was not the only eye that was watching
the Vicar of Ayrley. There is an ever-wakeful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Wisdom which ofttimes defeats my most subtle
schemes, leading the blind by a way they know not,
drawing back wandering souls to the orbit of duty,
even as that same Wisdom hangs the round world
upon nothing, and guides the stars in their courses!
My chain was suddenly snapped asunder by a blow
which came from a hand of love, but which, in its
needful force, laid prostrate the soul which it saved.
Aumerle’s loved partner was smitten with sickness,
smitten unto death, and the doating husband wrestled
in agonizing prayer for her who was dearer to him
than life. The prayer was not granted, for the
wings of the saint were fledged. She escaped, like
a freed bird, from the power of temptation, for ever!
Her husband remained behind,—Lawrence Aumerle
was an altered man. Earth had lost for him its
alluring charm, and enchained his affections no more.
He was softened—humbled,” continued Pride, with
the bitterness of one who records his own defeat,
“and in another world he will reckon as the most
signal mercy of his life the tempest which scattered
his joys, and dashed his hopes to the ground! Let
us not speak of him more,” continued the fierce spirit
with impatience; “his younger brother, the stately
Augustine, will not shake off my yoke so lightly.”</p>

<p>“His pride may well be personal pride,” said
Intemperance, following the direction of the glance
of his stern companion, “if that be he who, with
the rest of the congregation, is now obeying the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
summons of the church bells. Mine eyes never
rested on a more goodly man.”</p>

<p>“<em>Personal</em> pride!” repeated the dark one with a
mocking laugh, “Augustine Aumerle is by far too
proud for that. He would not stoop to so childish
a weakness. No, his is the pride of intellect, the
pride of conscious genius, the pride to mortals, perhaps,
the most perilous of all, which trusts its own
power to explore impenetrable mystery, and thereby
involves in a hopeless labyrinth; that seeks to sound
unfathomable depths, and may sink for ever in the
attempt.”</p>

<p>“Is he then a sceptic?” inquired Intemperance.</p>

<p>“No, not yet, <em>not yet</em>,” murmured the tempter;
“but I am leading him in the way to become one.
I am leading him as I have before led some of the
most brilliant sons of genius. I have made them
trust their own waxen wings, rely on the strength
of their own reason, and the higher they have risen
in their flight, the deeper and darker has been their
fall.” A gleam of savage triumph, like a flash from a
dark cloud, passed over the evil spirit as he spoke.</p>

<p>“Who is he with the long white hair,” asked
his companion, “who even now glanced up at these
old towers with an expression so stern and so sad?”</p>

<p>“He who was once their heir,” replied Pride.
“You see Timon Bardon, whom you and I disinherited
through the power which we possessed over
his father.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>“Have you not thereby lost the son?” asked Intemperance.
“Would not the pride of wealth—”</p>

<p>He was rudely interrupted by his associate—“Know
you not that there is also a pride of poverty?”
he cried. “Have you forgotten that there is the acid
fermentation as well as the vinous? Ha! ha! my
influence is recognised over the rich and the great;
but who knows—who knows,” he repeated, clenching
his shadowy hand, “in how heavy a grasp I can hold
down the poor! But I can no longer linger here,”
continued Pride; “I must mingle with yon crowd
of worshippers, even as they enter the house of
prayer. Unless I keep close at the side of each, they
may derive some benefit from the sermon, from forgetting
to criticise the preacher.”</p>

<p>“And I,” exclaimed Intemperance, “must now
away to do my work of death amongst such as never
enter a house of prayer.”</p>

<p>And so the two evil spirits parted, each on his
own dark errand. My tale deals only with Pride, and
rather as his influence is seen in the actions and
characters of the human beings to whom the preceding
conversation related, than as possessing any
distinct existence of his own. Let these three first
chapters be regarded as a preface in dialogue, explaining
the design of my little volume; or as a
glimpse of the hidden clockwork which, itself unseen,
directs the movements of everyday life. Most
thankful should I be if such a glimpse could induce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
my reader to look nearer at home; if, when ubiquitous
Pride speaks to the various characters in
this tale, the reader should ask himself whether there
be not something familiar in the tone of that voice,
and with a searching glance examine whether his
own soul be clogged with no link of the tyrant’s
chain,—whether he himself be not a prisoner of
Pride.</p>

<p>The “small grey speck” just visible from the summit
of Nettleby Tower, on nearer approach expands
into a stone cottage, which, excepting that it has
two storeys instead of one, and can boast an iron
knocker to the door, and an apology for a verandah
round the window, has little that could serve to distinguish
it from the dwelling of a common labourer.</p>

<p>We will not pause in the little garden, even to
look at the bed of polyanthus in which its possessor
takes great pride; we will at once enter the single
sitting-room which occupies almost the whole of the
ground floor, and after taking a glance at the apartment,
give a little attention to its occupants.</p>

<p>It is evident, even on the most superficial survey,
that different tastes have been concerned in the
fitting up of the cottage. Most of the furniture is
plain, even to coarseness; the table is of deal, and
so are the chairs, but over the first a delicate cover<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
has been thrown, and the latter—to the annoyance
of the master of the house—are adorned with a
variety of tidies, which too often form themselves
into superfluous articles of dress for those who
chance to occupy the seats. The wall is merely
white-washed, but there has been an attempt to
make it look gay, by hanging on it pale watercolour
drawings of flowers, bearing but an imperfect
resemblance to nature. One end of the room is devoted
to the arts, and bears unmistakable evidence
of the presence of woman in the dwelling. A green
guitar-box, from which peeps a broad pink ribbon,
occupies a place in the corner, half hidden by a little
table, on which, most carefully arranged, appear
several small articles of vertu. A tiny, round
mirror occupies the centre, attached to an ornamental
receptacle for cards; two or three miniatures in
morocco cases, diminutive cups and saucers of porcelain,
and a pair of china figures which have suffered
from time, the one wanting an arm and the other a
head,—these form the chief treasures of the collection,
if I except a few gaily bound books, which are
so disposed as to add to the general effect.</p>

<p>At this end of the room sits a lady engaged in
cutting out a tissue paper ornament for the grate;
for though the weather is cold, no chilliness of atmosphere
would be thought to justify a fire in that
room from the 1st of April to that of November.
The lady, who is the only surviving member of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
family of Timon Bardon and his late wife the
farmer’s daughter, seems to have numbered between
thirty and forty years of age,—it would be difficult
to say to which date the truth inclines, for Cecilia
herself would never throw light on the subject. Miss
Bardon’s complexion is sallow; her tresses light, the
eye-lashes lighter, and the brows but faintly defined.
There is a general appearance of whity brown about
the face, which is scarcely redeemed from insipidity
by the lustre of a pair of mild, grey eyes.</p>

<p>But if there be a want of colour in the countenance,
the same fault cannot be found in the attire,
which is not only studiously tasteful and neat, but
richer in texture, and more fashionable in style, than
might have been expected in the occupant of so poor
a cottage. The fact is, that Cecilia Bardon’s pride
and passion is dress; it has been her weakness since
the days of her childhood, when a silly mother delighted
to deck out her first-born in all the extravagance
of fashion. It is this pride which makes
the struggle with poverty more severe, and which is
the source of the selfishness which occasionally surprises
her friends in one, on all other points, the
most kindly and considerate of women. Cecilia
would rather go without a meal than wear cotton
gloves, and a silk dress affords her more delight than
any intellectual feast. She had a sore struggle in
her mind whether to expend the little savings of her
allowance on a much-needed curtain to the window<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
to keep out draughts in winter and glare in summer,
a subscription to the village school, or a pair of
fawn-coloured kid boots, which had greatly taken
her fancy. Prudence, Charity, Vanity, contended together,
but the fawn-coloured boots carried the day!
One of them is now resting on a footstool, shewing
off as neat a little foot as ever trod on a Brussels
carpet,—at least, such is the opinion of its possessor.
Grim Pride must have laughed when he framed his
fetters of such flimsy follies as these!</p>

<p>Opposite to Cecilia sits her father, whose appearance,
as well as character, offers a strong contrast to
that of his daughter. Dr. Bardon is a man who,
though his dress be of the commonest description,
could hardly be passed in a crowd without notice.
His dark eyes flash under thick, beetling, black
brows with all the fire of youth; and but for the
long white hair which falls almost as low as his
shoulders, and furrows on each side of the mouth,
caused by a trick of frequently drawing the corners
downwards, Timon Bardon would appear almost too
young to be the father of Cecilia. There is something
leonine in the whole cast of his countenance,
something that conveys an impression that he holds
the world at bay, will shake his white mane at its
darts, and make it feel the power of his claws. The
doctor’s occupation, however, at present is of the
quietest description,—he is reading an old volume of
theology, and his mind is absorbed in his subject.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Presently a muttered “Good!” shows that he is
satisfied with his author, and Bardon, after vainly
searching his pockets, rises to look for a pencil to
mark the passage that he approves.</p>

<p>He saunters up to Cecilia’s show-table, and examines
the ornamental card-rack attached to the tiny
round mirror.</p>

<p>“Never find anything useful here!” he growls to
himself; then, addressing his daughter, “Why don’t
you throw away these dirty cards, I’m sick of the
very sight of them!”</p>

<p>Cecilia half rises in alarm, which occasions a
shower of little pink paper cuttings to flutter from
her knee to the floor. “O papa! don’t, don’t
throw them away; they’re the countess’s wedding
cards!”</p>

<p>Down went the corners of the lips. “Were they
a duchess’s,” said Dr. Bardon, “there would be no
reason for sticking them there for years.”</p>

<p>“Only one year and ten months since Annabella
married,” timidly interposed Cecilia.</p>

<p>“What is it to me if it be twenty!” said the
doctor, walking up and down the room as he spoke;
“she’s nothing to us, and we’re nothing to her!”</p>

<p>“O papa! you used always to like Annabella.”</p>

<p>“I liked Annabella well enough, but I don’t care
a straw for the countess; and if she had cared for
me, she’d have managed to come four miles to see
me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>“She has been abroad for some time, and—”</p>

<p>“And she has done with little people like us,” said
the doctor, drawing himself up to his full height, and
looking as if he did not feel himself to be little at
all. “I force my acquaintance on no one, and would
not give one flower from my garden for the cards of
all the peerage.”</p>

<p>Cecilia felt the conversation unpleasant, and did
not care to keep it up. She bent down, and picked
up one by one the scraps of pink paper which she
had scattered. Something like a sigh escaped from
her lips.</p>

<p>Dr. Bardon was the first to speak.</p>

<p>“I saw Augustine Aumerle yesterday at church;
I suppose he’s on a visit to his brother the vicar.”</p>

<p>“How very, very handsome he is!” remarked
Cecilia.</p>

<p>“You women are such fools,” said the doctor, “you
think of nothing but looks.”</p>

<p>“But he’s so clever too, so wonderfully clever!
They say he carried off all the honours at Cambridge.”</p>

<p>“Much good they will do him,” growled the
doctor, throwing himself down on his chair; “I got
honours too when I was at college, and I might
better have been sowing turnips for any advantage
I’ve had out of them. It’s the fool that gets on in
the world!”</p>

<p>This, by the way, was a favourite axiom of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
Bardon’s, first adopted at the suggestion of Pride, as
being highly consolatory to one who had never
managed to get on in the world.</p>

<p>“I think that I see Ida and Mabel Aumerle crossing
the road,” said Cecilia, glancing out of the window.
“How beautiful Ida is, and so charming! I
declare I think she’s an angel!”</p>

<p>“She’s well enough,” replied the doctor, in a tone
which said that she was that, but nothing more.</p>

<p>In a short time a little tap was heard at the door,
and the vicar’s daughters were admitted. Ida indeed
looked lovely; a rapid walk in a cold wind
had brought a brilliant rose to her cheek, and as
she laid on the table a large paper parcel which she
and her sister had carried by turns, her eyes beamed
with benevolent pleasure. Mabel was far less attractive
in appearance than her sister, a small upturned
nose robbing her face of all pretensions to
beauty beyond what youth and good-humour might
give; but she also looked bright and happy, for the
girl’s errand was one of kindness. The want of a
curtain in Bardon’s cold room had been noticed by
others than Cecilia, and the parcel contained a crimson
one made up by the young ladies themselves.</p>

<p>“Oh! what a beauty! what a love!” exclaimed
Cecilia, in the enthusiasm of grateful admiration.
“Papa, only see what a splendid curtain dear Ida
and Mabel have brought us!”</p>

<p>The doctor was not half so enthusiastic. It has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
been said that there are four arts difficult of attainment,—<em>how
to give reproof, how to take reproof, how
to give a present, and how to receive one</em>. This
difficulty is chiefly owing to pride. Timon Bardon
was more annoyed at a want having been perceived,
than gratified at its having been removed. He
would gladly enough have obliged the daughters of
his pastor, but to be under even a small obligation
to them was a burden to his sensitive spirit. He
could hardly thank his young friends; and a stranger
might have judged from his manner that the
Aumerles were depriving him of something that he
valued, rather than adding to his comforts. But
Ida knew Bardon’s character well, and made allowance
for the temper of a peevish, disappointed man.
She seated herself by Cecilia, and began at once on a
different topic.</p>

<p>“I have a message for you, Miss Bardon. I saw
Annabella on Saturday.”</p>

<p>“The countess!” cried the expectant Cecilia.</p>

<p>“She was at our house, and regretted that the
threatening weather prevented her driving on here.”</p>

<p>“I’d have been so delighted!” interrupted
Cecilia, while the doctor muttered to himself some
inaudible remark.</p>

<p>“But she desired me to say, with her love, how
much pleasure it would give her if you and her old
friend the doctor (these were her words) would
come to see her at Dashleigh Hall.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>The grey eyes of Miss Bardon lighted up with
irrepressible pleasure, and even the gruff old doctor
uttered a rather complacent grunt.</p>

<p>“She begged,” said Mabel, “that you would
drive over some morning and take luncheon, and let
her show you over the garden and park.”</p>

<p>“Then she’s not changed, dear creature!” exclaimed
Cecilia.</p>

<p>“And she hopes before long,” continued Mabel,
“to find herself again at Milton Cottage.”</p>

<p>“Mill Cottage,” said the doctor gruffly; for the
name of his tenement had for many years been a
disputed subject between him and his daughter
Cecilia;—“there’s common sense in that name:
Mill Cottage, because it was once connected with a
mill. To turn it into ‘Milton’ is pure nonsense
and affectation. A fine title would hang about as
well on this place as knee-buckles and ruff on a
ploughman!” And having thus given his oracular
opinion, Dr. Bardon strolled out into his garden,
leaving the young ladies to pursue uninterrupted
conversation together, none the less agreeable for his
absence.</p>

<p>“You will excuse papa,” said Cecilia, feeling that
some apology was required for her father’s abrupt
departure.</p>

<p>Dr. Bardon’s manner was far rougher and less
courteous than it would have been had he appeared
as the lord of Nettleby Tower, instead of a poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
surgeon with indifferent practice. Whether it were
that he was soured by disappointment, or that his
pride shrank from the idea of appearing to cringe to
those more favoured by fortune than himself, it
would be perhaps difficult to determine; he appeared
to consider that true dignity consisted in despising
those outward advantages which he would probably
have overvalued had he himself possessed them.
Thus, while Cecilia’s pride led her to make the best
possible appearance, and catch any reflected gleam
of grandeur from opulent or titled acquaintance, Dr.
Bardon rather gloried in the meanness of his home,
never cared to hide the patch upon his coat, and
considered himself equal in his poverty to any peer
who wore the garter and the George.</p>

<p>The doctor appeared to have walked off his ill-humour,
for when Ida and Mabel bade adieu to Miss
Bardon, they found him ready to escort them to his
gate. With not ungraceful courtesy he presented
the young ladies with a nosegay of his choicest
hyacinths, and even condescended to say that he
valued their present for the sake of the fair hands
that had worked it! There was something of the
“fine old English gentleman” lingering yet about
the disinherited man.</p>

<p>“Now the doctor’s happy! he has got rid of his
gratitude! I knew how it would be!” laughed
Mabel, as soon as the girls had walked beyond reach
of hearing.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” asked Ida.</p>

<p>“Did you not see how uncomfortable the poor
man was under the weight of even such a little
obligation? It was steam high pressure with him,
till he opened a safety-valve, and off flew all his
debt discharged in the shape of a bunch of hyacinths!”</p>

<p>“How you talk!” said her sister with a smile;
“he intended these poor little flowers as a mark of
attention; they were no return for our present.”</p>

<p>“O Ida, how little you know! Why, Dr.
Bardon does not think that there are hyacinths
in the world that can bear comparison with his.
He thinks them worth any money. He carries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
a mental glass of very singular construction, patented
by the maker, Pride. Look through the one end,
everything is small; look through the other, everything
is big! He turns the magnifier to what he
does himself, the diminisher to what others do for
him; and it is wonderful how he thus manages to
economize gratitude, and keep himself out of debt to
his friends. Depend upon it, seen through his glass,
his hyacinths swelled to the size of hollyhocks,
and our curtain diminished to that of a sampler!”</p>

<p>“You are a sad satirical girl!” said Ida.</p>

<p>“Not I, I’ve only practised the ‘vigilance of
observation and accuracy of distinction, which neither
books nor precepts can teach,’ which the famous Mr.
Jenkins used to recommend to papa when he was
young. I am merely distinguishing between the
kindnesses which a man does to please a friend, and
those which he does to gratify his own pride. Dr.
Bardon, in spite of his poverty, is as proud as the
Earl of Dashleigh can be.”</p>

<p>“But he is one who deserves much indulgence.”</p>

<p>“I am not saying anything against him,” interrupted
Mabel; “I rather like a dash of pride in
a character; I know I have plenty of it myself.”</p>

<p>“Mabel—”</p>

<p>“Why, darling, I’m proud of you!” exclaimed
Mabel, turning her eyes affectionately on her sister;
“and I’m proud of my excellent father, proud of my
glorious uncle, but I am not proud,”—here Mabel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
laughed,—“I’m not proud of my step-mother at
all.”</p>

<p>“Mabel, dearest—”</p>

<p>“I’m convinced that the world may be divided
into two classes—those made of porcelain, and those
of crockery. There seems such a wonderful difference
in the nature of minds, into whatever shape
education may twist them! Now, my father, uncle,
and you, are made of real Sevres porcelain, and Mrs.
Aumerle—”</p>

<p>“Really, Mabel, you do wrong to speak thus of
her.”</p>

<p>“Well, I won’t if you don’t like it, darling, but
she’s so intensely common-place and matter-of-fact!
I don’t believe that she understands or could enter
into our feelings any more than if we had been born
in different planets!”</p>

<p>Ida sighed. “It is our appointed trial,” she
replied; and these few words, though well intended,
did more to impress upon her young sister the hardship
of having an uncongenial stepmother, than open
complaint might have done. Mabel regarded her
gentle sister as a suffering saint, and had no idea
that there might be two sides even to such a question
as this.</p>

<p>Ida’s conscience warned her that the preceding
conversation had been unprofitable, to say the least
of it, and she knew well what Scripture saith against
<em>every idle word</em>. She therefore turned the channel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
of discourse, and told Mabel of her new plan of having
a class for farm-boys, which she intended herself
to conduct.</p>

<p>“You can’t manage more upon Sundays, Ida; you
have two classes already, you know.”</p>

<p>“True; this must be on the Saturday evening,
when the lads have left off work.”</p>

<p>“You can’t have the school-room, then; that’s
Mrs. Aumerle’s time for the mother’s class.”</p>

<p>“I have been thinking about that,” said Ida,
gravely; “but there is really no other hour that will
be suitable at all for mine. I must ask Mrs.
Aumerle to have her women a little earlier in the
afternoon.”</p>

<p>“I would not ask a favour of her!” said Mabel
proudly.</p>

<p>“It is never pleasant to ask favours,” replied Ida;
“but it is sometimes our duty to do so.”</p>

<p>It was growing dark before the sisters reached
their home. They found Mrs. Aumerle busily engaged
in cutting out clothes for the poor, wielding
her large, bright scissors with quick hand, and directing
its operations with an experienced eye. She
looked up from her occupation as Ida and Mabel
entered the room.</p>

<p>“What has made you so late?” asked the lady.</p>

<p>“Oh! we have had a nice, long chat with Cecily
Bardon,” replied Mabel; “we never thought of the
hour.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>“I hope that you will think of it another time,”
said Mrs. Aumerle, resuming her cutting and clipping;
“it is not proper for young ladies to be crossing the
fields after sunset without an escort.”</p>

<p>“Not proper!” repeated Mabel half aloud, her
cheek suffused with an angry flush.</p>

<p>“We have been always accustomed,” said Ida
more calmly, “to walk whither and at what hour we
pleased, and we have never found the smallest inconvenience
arise from so doing.”</p>

<p>“Your having done so is no reason why you
should do so,” said the lady firmly; “you have been
too much left to yourselves, and it is well that you
have now some one of a little experience to judge
what is suitable or unsuitable for two young girls of
your age.”</p>

<p>Mabel turned down the corners of her mouth after
the fashion of Dr. Bardon; happily Mrs. Aumerle
was too busy with a jacket-sleeve to look at her step-daughter’s
face. Ida seated herself without reply;
but Pride stole up at that moment and whispered in
her ear, “You can manage quite as well for yourself
as the meddling dame can manage for you. She
might be content to let well alone, and confine herself
to her own affairs.”</p>

<p>Ida now entered upon the subject of the class for
farmers’ boys and labouring lads, and explained the
necessity for holding it on the particular day and
hour on which the mothers’ meeting usually took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
place. She dwelt with gentle eloquence upon the
difficulties and temptations of the youths who would
be benefited by the new arrangement; but it tried
her patience not a little to hear the snip-snip of the
scissors all the time that she was speaking.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll consider the matter,” said Mrs. Aumerle,
stopping at length in her occupation; “it will cause
me a little inconvenience, but I think that the thing
may be managed. But,” she continued, as Ida,
having gained her point, was about to leave the
apartment, “but we have not thought of the most
important thing—who is to conduct the class?”</p>

<p>“I had thought of it,” replied Ida; “I am going
to conduct it myself.”</p>

<p>“You!” exclaimed Mrs. Aumerle, turning towards
Ida a face whose naturally high colour was heightened
by stooping over her cutting; “you! the thing is
not to be dreamed of! Your father’s daughter to be
teaching and preaching to a set of hulking farm lads,
as if they were a parcel of little schoolboys! It
would not become a young lady like you.”</p>

<p>“I have yet to learn what can become a lady, be
she old or young, better than teaching the ignorant
and helping the poor,” said Ida with forced calmness,
but great constraint and coldness of manner.</p>

<p>“Oh! that’s very fine talking, my dear; the
thing may be a very good thing in itself, but we
must choose different instruments for different kinds
of work. One would not mend quills with scissors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
or cut out flannel with a penknife. I can’t hear of
your holding such a class.”</p>

<p>Commanding herself sufficiently not to reply, but
with an angry and swelling heart Ida sought her
own room, followed by the indignant Mabel. No
sooner had they reached it than Mabel threw her
arms around Ida, and exclaimed, “My own darling,
angel sister! how dared she speak so to you!”</p>

<p>“She will grieve one day,” said Ida, struggling
to keep down tears, “that she has put any stumbling-block
in the way of such a work. Mabel, we must
pity and pray for her!”</p>

<p>“And never let yourselves be led by her,” suggested
Pride.</p>

<p>“That girl wants somebody to guide her;” such
were the reflections of Mrs. Aumerle, as she went on
with her work for the poor. “There’s a great deal
of good in her, but she wants ballast,—she wants
common-sense. She is spoilt by being so long without
the control of a mother, and needs, almost as
much as saucy Mabel, a good firm hand over her.
With all Ida’s gentleness and meekness, there’s in
her a world of obstinacy and pride. I wish that I
had brought one verse to her recollection, which she
seems to leave out when she reads the Bible—<em>Likewise
ye younger, submit yourselves unto the
elder; yea, all of you be subject one to another, and
be clothed with humility; for God resisteth the proud,
and giveth grace to the humble.</em> Ida has a wonderful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
conceit of her own opinion, as most inexperienced
young people have; and it’s almost impossible to
convince her that she ever can be wrong. She is not
wrong, however, about the duty of having a class for
these poor farm lads; I must consult Lawrence as to
how it can be done.” The lady went on with her
cogitations upon the subject. “We could not expect
our schoolmaster to undertake such an addition to
his labours. The clerk, Ashby—no, no, he’s not fitted
for it; he’d set the young fellows yawning,—no one
would come twice for his teaching. Perhaps the
best plan would be for me to take the lads myself,
and give up my mother’s meeting to Ida. It would
be far more suitable for a pretty young creature like
her. But I must keep the cutting out and shaping
of the poor-clothes still, for clever as she is in reading
and talking, that is a business which poor Ida
never could manage with all the goodwill in the
world.”</p>

<p>And so the plain, practical stepmother settled the
matter in her own mind; and only Pride could suggest
that her plan was inconvenient, inconsiderate,
or unkind. It was ultimately adopted by Ida, but
with a reluctance and coldness which deprived both
ladies of the encouragement and pleasure which they
would have derived from cheerful, hearty, co-operation
with each other in labours of love.</p>

<p>The visit of the sisters Aumerle, or rather the
message which they had brought, had caused great
excitement in the mind of Cecilia Bardon. One
thought was now uppermost there, thrusting itself
forward at all times, interfering with domestic duties,
taking her attention even from her prayers; that
thought was—how should she persuade her father to
pay a visit to Dashleigh Hall!</p>

<p>Dr. Bardon held out against entreaties for two
days; on the third he yielded, having probably all
along only made show of fight to avoid seeming
eagerly to catch at an invitation from a titled
acquaintance.</p>

<p>The next question was—How was the visit to be
paid? Four miles was a distance too great to be
traversed on foot by Cecilia Bardon.</p>

<p>“We could get a neat clarence from Pelton,” suggested
the lady.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>“Pelton!” exclaimed the doctor,—“why, Pelton is
six miles off! You’ll not find me paying for a
clarence to go twenty miles to carry me to a place
to which I could walk any fine morning. I’ve not
money to fling away after that fashion.”</p>

<p>“If only the Aumerles kept a carriage!” sighed
Cecilia.</p>

<p>“If they kept fifty I’d not ask for the loan of
one,” said the doctor, with all the pride of poverty.</p>

<p>“Dear me! how shall we ever get to Dashleigh
Hall!” cried Cecilia.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what, I’ll hire our neighbour the
farmer’s donkey-chaise,—that won’t ruin even a poor
man like me.”</p>

<p>“A donkey-chaise!” exclaimed Miss Bardon in
horror.</p>

<p>“Why, you’ve been glad enough of it before now
to carry you over to Pelton, when you had shopping
to do in the town.”</p>

<p>“Pelton,—why, yes,—shopping,—but to call on
a countess!”</p>

<p>“A countess, I suppose, is made of flesh and blood
like other people; if she’s such an idiot as to care
whether her friends come to her in chariots or
donkey-chaises, the less we have to do with her the
better, say I.”</p>

<p>“But to drive through the park—to go up to the
grand hall, to—to—to be seen by all the fine
liveried servants—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>The doctor actually stamped with impatience.
“What is it to us,” he cried, “if all the lackeys in
Christendom were to see us? We’re doing nothing
wrong—nothing to be ashamed of. I should be as
much a gentleman in a chaise, or a cart, drawn by a
donkey or a dog, as if I’d fifty racers in my stables,
and a handle a mile long to my name.”</p>

<p>The pride of the father and the daughter were at
variance, but it was the same passion that worked in
both. Cecilia sought dignity in accessories, Dr. Bardon
found it in self. She would climb up to distinction
in the world by grasping at every advantage held
out by the rank and wealth of her friends; he would
rise also, but by trampling under foot rank and wealth
as things to be despised. The pride of the daughter
was most ridiculous—that of the father most deadly.
Reader, do you know nothing of either?</p>

<p>One of the things on which Bardon prided himself
was on being master in his own house—no very
difficult matter, as his subjects consisted but of one
gentle-tempered daughter, and one old deaf domestic.
On the present occasion Cecilia soon found that she
must go to Dashleigh Hall in a donkey-carriage, if
she intended to go at all; and after a longer
struggle than usual, which ended in something like
tears, she yielded to the pressure of circumstances,
and consented to accompany her father the next day
in the ignoble vehicle which he had selected. This
point settled, her mind was free to give itself to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
darling subject of dress. Half the day was devoted
to touching and retouching last summer’s bonnet,
which looked rather the worse for wear, and selecting
such articles of attire as might give a distinguished
and fashionable air to the lady of Milton
Cottage. Cecilia was not unsuccessful. Never,
perhaps, had a more elegantly dressed woman
stepped into a donkey-chaise before. Her flounced
silk dress expanded to such fashionable dimensions as
scarcely to leave space in the humble conveyance for
the accommodation of the doctor.</p>

<p>If her dress was an object of triumph to Miss Bardon,
it was also one of solicitude and care. Never,
surely, were roads so dusty, and never was dust more
annoying. Her nervous anxiety and precautions
irritated the temper of the doctor, who found more
than enough to try it in the obstinacy of the animal
that he drove, without further provocation from his
companion. Both father and daughter were well
pleased when they at length reached the ornamental
lodge of Dashleigh Park.</p>

<p>“Papa,” suggested Cecilia timidly, “could we not
leave the donkey to graze in the lane, and go through
the grounds on foot?”</p>

<p>“Leave the hired donkey to be carried off by any
party of tramping gipsies! I’m not such a fool,” said
the doctor.</p>

<p>The lodge-keeper obeyed the summons of the bell,
which was rung with more force than was needful;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
he stood still, however, without opening the gate, to
inquire what the occupants of the donkey-chaise
wanted.</p>

<p>“Open the gate, will you?” cried the doctor, in
his rough, domineering manner.</p>

<p>“For Dr. and Miss Bardon, of Milton Cottage,
friends of the countess,” said Cecilia nervously, feeling
very uncomfortable at her own position.</p>

<p>The gate-keeper looked hesitatingly at the lady,
then at the chaise, then at the lady again. It is
possible that her appearance decided his doubts, or
that the impatience of the doctor overbore them, for
the gate slowly rolled back on its hinges, and the
donkey-chaise entered the park.</p>

<p>Cecilia could scarcely find any charm in the beautiful
drive, magnificent timber, verdant glades, broad
avenues affording glimpses of distant prospects, sunny
knolls on which grazed the light-footed deer. She
could not, however, refrain from an exclamation of
delight as a sudden bend in the road brought her unexpectedly
in sight of the lordly Hall.</p>

<p>Dr. Bardon surveyed the splendid building before
him with a gloomy, dissatisfied eye. What was it
compared to Nettleby Tower, in the mind of the disinherited
man? “Mere gingerbread! mere gingerbread!”
he muttered to himself, as he drew up at the
lofty entrance. He saw more beauty in a ruined buttress
of the ancient home of his fathers than in all the
florid decorations of the countess’s magnificent abode.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>Cecilia Bardon was well-nigh overpowered by the
sense of the grandeur before her. The presence of
three or four of the earl’s powdered footmen was
enough in itself to make her seat in the donkey-chaise
almost intolerable to the lady.</p>

<p>“Lady Dashleigh at home?” inquired the doctor
from his low seat, in a tone that would have sounded
haughty from a prince.</p>

<p>The countess was happily at home; and Cecilia,
hastily descending, breathed more freely when no
longer in contact with the odious conveyance. She
felt something as a prisoner may feel when he has
left the jail behind, his connection with which he
desires to forget, wishing that all others could do
so likewise. Dr. Bardon flung the rein on the neck of
the donkey, and followed his daughter into the Hall.</p>

<p>They were introduced into a splendid apartment,
fitted up with magnificence and taste. Poor Cecilia,
as she there awaited the countess, painfully contrasted
the room with its glittering mirrors and
gilded ceiling, painted panels and velvet cushions,
with the homeliness of her own humble abode.
Pride, who revels in human misery, would not
omit the opportunity of inflicting an envious pang.
But his barbed dart went deeper—far deeper into
the heart of the unhappy Bardon—the man who
would have scornfully laughed at the idea of the
possibility of such as he envying any mortal in the
world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>Cecilia had scarcely time to gaze around her,
shake out her dusty flounces, and glance in a mirror
to see if her scarf fell gracefully, when Annabella herself
appeared from an inner apartment.</p>

<p>The appearance of the youthful countess was rather
attractive than striking. Her figure was below the
middle height, and so light and delicate in its proportions
as to have earned for Annabella in girlhood the
title of Titania, queen of the fairies. Her complexion
had not the purity of that of her cousin Ida;
but any emotion or excitement suffused her cheek
with a beautiful crimson, and lit up the vivacious
dark eyes, which were the only decidedly pretty
feature in a face whose chief charm lay in its ever-varying
expression. The irregular outline of the
countess’s profile deprived her countenance of all
claim to absolute beauty, but no one when under
the spell of her winning conversation, could
pause to criticise or even notice defects where the
general effect was so pleasing. The dress of the
countess was not such as might have been expected
in one of her rank. It was picturesque rather than
costly, fanciful rather than fashionable. Annabella
had just been bending over her desk, busy with a
romance which she was writing; her tresses were
slightly disordered, and a small ink stain actually
soiled the whiteness of one little delicate finger.</p>

<p>Her greeting to Dr. and Miss Bardon was most
gracious and cordial. She came forward with both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
hands extended, and welcomed her old friends to
Dashleigh Hall with a frank kindliness which at once
set Cecilia at her ease. “She is not changed in the
least; she is the same fascinating being as ever,” was
the reflection of the gratified guest.</p>

<p>Dr. Bardon was not so easily won. He was out
of temper with himself and all the world. The touch
of pride had turned indeed his wine of life into a
concentrated acid. Annabella could not but notice
the hardness of his manner, but she was neither surprised
nor offended, for she knew the character of
the man. “I will conquer the old lion!” thought
she, and she exerted all her powers to do so. How
thoughtfully attentive the countess became, how she
humoured her guest’s little fancies, how she avoided
jarring upon his prejudices, and talked of old times,
old scenes, old friends, till she fairly beat down, one
after another, every barrier behind which ill-humour
could lurk!</p>

<p>Annabella took the arm of the doctor, and with
Cecilia at her side, sauntered down the marble terrace
into the garden. She consulted Timon Bardon
about the disposition of her flower-beds, asked advice
concerning the management of plants, and finally
overcame the old lion altogether by begging for a
slip from his Venice Sumach. The moment that
the doctor found that he could confer a favour instead
of accepting one, all his equanimity returned;
and when the party re-entered the beautiful drawing-room,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
the only shadow on the enjoyment of any of
the three was Cecilia’s consciousness that the gravel-walks
had impaired the beauty of her fawn-coloured
boots.</p>

<p>“What a sweet creature the countess is!” was
Miss Bardon’s silent reflection; “prosperity has
done her no harm; she has not a particle of
pride!”</p>

</div>

<p>“She has not a particle of pride!” Such may be
the judgment of the world, which looks not below
the surface, but the recording angel may give a
very different account. Let us examine a little more
closely into the character of the countess, and see if
she may fairly be ranked amongst the <em>poor in spirit</em>,
of whom is the <em>kingdom of heaven</em>.</p>

<p>Annabella had been an orphan almost from her
birth, and had been brought up by a tender grandmother,
since deceased, who had made an idol of her
little darling, the heiress to all her wealth. As soon
as the child had power to frame a sentence, that sentence
was law to the household. Annabella, the
fairy queen, acquired a habit of ruling, which gave a
permanent cast to her mind. Gifted with joyous
spirits, a sweet temper, and a strong desire to please,
her pride was seldom offensive. Annabella’s subjects
were willing, for the sovereign was beloved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>As the child grew into the woman, her views began
to expand; she desired a wider sway. Annabella
was not contented to rule merely in a household, to
influence only a small circle of friends. Like those
who cut their names on a pyramid, she was ambitious
of leaving her mark on the world. The only
instrument by which it seemed possible to accomplish
this object of ambition was the pen. If “the press” is
the fourth power in the state, Annabella resolved to
have a share in that power. She had a lively fancy,
a ready wit, and, to her transporting delight, her first
essay was successful. The young lady’s contributions
to a monthly periodical were indeed sent under a
<i lang="fr">nom de guerre</i>, but Annabella’s darling hope was to
make that adopted title of “Egeria” famous throughout
the land.</p>

<p>It was at this point of her history that the Earl
of Dashleigh, smarting under the sting of mortified
pride, and casually thrown much into the charming
society of Annabella, made her the offer of his hand.
The eye of the young heiress had not, like that of
her cousin Ida, been fixed upon objects so high that
the glare of earthly grandeur died away before it
like the sparkles of fireworks below. Annabella was
completely dazzled by the idea of such a brilliant
alliance. Her imagination immediately invested the
young earl with every great and glorious quality.
Love threw a halo around him, and the maiden fancied
that she saw realized in her noble suitor every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
poetical dream of her girlhood. Nor was love the
only chord that vibrated to rapture in the heart of
Dashleigh’s young bride. Did not this elevation to
rank and dignity offer at once a wider sphere to her
eager ambition? From the rapidity of her conquest,
Annabella deemed that her power over the earl
would be unbounded, little imagining how much that
conquest was owing to the effect of his pride and
pique.</p>

<p>Marriage soon undeceived Annabella. She found
herself united to a man at least as proud as herself,
though his pride took a different form. As long as
the bride was contented simply to please, there was
domestic harmony; Annabella was happy in her
husband, and he thought that no companion could be
so agreeable as his witty and lively wife. But the
moment that the countess attempted to rule, the
elements of discord began to work. The earl, who
never lost consciousness of high birth and distinguished
rank, was aware that he had married one
who, though of good family, was yet considerably
below himself in social position. This, however,
would have mattered little, had Annabella readily
accommodated herself to the new circumstances in
which she was placed. The nobleman, in the famous
old tale, had deigned to wed even the humble Griselda;
he had had no reason to regret his choice, but
then there was a difference, wide as north from south,
between Griselda and Annabella! As soon as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
young countess became aware that her husband felt
that he had stooped a little when he raised her to
share his rank, all her pride at once rose in arms.
She was more determined than ever to assert the
independence which she regarded as the right of her
sex.</p>

<p>The bond which pride had first helped to form
was ill fitted to bear the daily strain which was now
put upon it. Annabella, all the romance of courtship
over, saw her idol without its gilding, the halo
of fancy faded away, and he over whom its lustre had
been thrown, appeared but as an ordinary mortal.
In a thousand little ways, scarcely apparent to any
but the parties immediately concerned, the habits
and wishes of the ill-assorted couple jarred painfully
on each other. Pride revelled in his work of mischief
as he glided from the one to the other.</p>

<p>“Your wife,” he would whisper to the earl, “with
all her talents, and all her charms, is ill fitted for the
station which she holds. She has not the dignity,
the stateliness of mien which would beseem the lady
of Dashleigh Hall. She has vulgar tastes, vulgar
friends, vulgar amusements. Her very dress is not
such as becomes the wife of a peer of the realm. She
is giddy, fantastic, and vain, and altogether devoid
of a due sense of your condescension in placing her
at the head of your splendid establishment. Your
choice has been a mistake.”</p>

<p>Then the spirit of mischief would breathe out his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
treason to Annabella: “Your husband, if superior
to you in descent, you have now discovered to be so
in no single other point. He has neither your wit
nor your spirit. He is rather a weak, though an
obstinate man, and thinks much more than common-sense
warrants of what has been called ‘the accident
of birth.’ Have you not much more reason to exult
in belonging to the aristocracy of talent, than that of
mere rank like him? Do you glory in the name of
Countess as you do in that of ‘Egeria,’ by which
alone you are known to reading thousands?”</p>

<p>Having thus given my readers a glimpse of “the
skeleton in the house” where all appears outwardly
so full of enjoyment, I will take up my thread where
I laid it down, and return to the drawing-room of
Dashleigh Hall.</p>

<p>Dr. Bardon, as we have seen, had been restored to
good humour by the tact and attentions of the countess,
and Cecilia exhausted all her superlatives in
admiration of everything that she saw. The conversation
flowed pleasantly between Annabella and
the doctor, for Bardon was a well read and intelligent
man, and literature was the countess’s passion.
Cecilia, however, found the discourse assuming too
much of the character of a <i lang="fr">tête-a-tête</i>, and not being
content to remain exclusively a listener, watched
eagerly for an opportunity to drop in her little contribution
to “the feast of reason and the flow of soul.”</p>

<p>“Yes, the world is much like a library,” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
Annabella, in reply to an observation from the doctor,
“but most persons enter it rather to give a
superficial glance at the binding of the books, than
to make themselves masters of the contents.”</p>

<p>“They are satisfied if the gilding lie thick enough
on the backs of the tomes,” said the doctor.</p>

<p>“But what a deep, what a curious study would every
character be, if we could read it through from beginning
to end (skipping the preface, of course, for
school-boys and school-girls are objects of natural
aversion). What romances would some lives disclose—while
others would offer the most forcible sermons
that ever were written. What exquisite beauty,
what touching poetry we might find in the daily
course of some whom now we regard with little
attention!”</p>

<p>“Your lovely Cousin Ida, for instance,” chimed
in Cecilia, trying to catch the tone of the conversation,
“I always think of her as a living poem!”</p>

<p>“If Ida be a poem,” said Annabella rather coldly,
“she is certainly one in blank verse,—a new version
of ‘Young’s Night Thoughts,’ exceedingly admirable
and sublime!”</p>

<p>The countess had always professed herself attached
to her cousin, with whom she had from childhood
interchanged a thousand little tokens of affection.
She would have done much to promote the happiness
of Ida, or to avert from her any real sorrow, and yet—strange
contradiction—Annabella never liked to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
hear warm praise of her friend. It almost appeared
as though the countess considered the admiration
accorded to her beautiful cousin as so much subtracted
from herself. When just commendation of
another excites an uneasy sensation in our minds, we
need no supernatural power to recognise in it the
fretting jar of the jealous chain which pride has fixed
on our souls.</p>

<p>Annabella was also at this time a little displeased
with her cousin. Ida Aumerle, from motives of
delicacy which the reader will understand though
the countess could not, had declined repeated invitations
to pay a long visit to Dashleigh Hall. Annabella,
who was eager to show her new possessions to
the friend of her youth, was hurt at what appeared
to her to be coldness, if not unkindness. To be
<em>easily offended</em> is one of the most indubitable marks of
pride, and from this Annabella was certainly not free.</p>

<p>While the preceding conversation was proceeding
in the drawing-room, a horseman, attended by a
groom, rode up to the entrance of Dashleigh Hall.
He was a man who had scarcely yet reached the
meridian of life. His figure was graceful, though
affording small promise of physical strength; his
features well-formed, and of almost feminine delicacy,
though the prevailing expression which sat upon
them was one of conscious superiority,—now softening
into condescension, now, at any real or imagined
affront, rising into that of offended dignity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>Reginald, Earl of Dashleigh—for this was he—seemed,
figuratively speaking, never to be out of the
cumbersome robes in which, on state occasions, he
appeared as a peer of the realm. Whether he
mingled in society, or conversed alone with his wife,
proffered hospitality, or received it, he appeared to
feel the weight of a coronet always encircling his
brow. The question which he asked himself before
entering upon any line of action, was less whether it
were right or wrong, prudent or foolish, as whether
it were worthy of Reginald, twelfth Earl of Dashleigh.
Pride had kept the young nobleman from
many of the vices and follies of his age; pride had
prevented him from doing anything that might
injure his character in the eyes of the world, and
had led him to do many things which gained for
him popular applause; but pride, at the best, is but
a miserable substitute for a higher principle of
action; its fruits may appear fair to the eye, but
are dust and corruption within.</p>

<p>The earl was not a remarkably skilful rider.
Nature had not gifted him with either muscular
strength or iron nerve. At the moment that he
reached his own door his horsemanship was put to
unpleasant proof. An incident, ludicrous as that
which Cowper has celebrated in his humorous poem,
proved that the same mishaps may overtake a peer
of the realm, and “a citizen of credit and renown.”
The sudden, prolonged bray of a donkey—most unwonted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
sound in that lordly place—startled the steed
which was ridden by the earl. Its sudden plunge
unseated its rider, and the illustrious aristocrat
measured his length upon the road! The accident
was of no serious nature; the nobleman was in an
instant again on his feet, shaking the dust from his
garments; nothing had suffered from the fall but
Reginald’s dignity, and, consequently, his temper.
The accident appeared absurd from its cause, and
Dashleigh was more provoked at the occurrence
than he might have been had some grave evil befallen
him.</p>

<p>“How came that brute there?” he exclaimed to
the servants, who officiously crowded around him
with proffers of assistance, which were impatiently
rejected by their master. “How came that brute
there?” he angrily repeated, looking indignantly at
the animal which had drawn Dr. Bardon’s humble
conveyance, and which was now quietly feeding in
the luxuriant pasture of the park.</p>

<p>“Please you, my lord, visitors to see her ladyship
came in that chaise,” replied a footman, scarcely
able to suppress a smile.</p>

<p>“Visitors!” said the earl sharply; “the milliner
or the dressmaker, I suppose. Tell Mills at the
lodge never again to suffer such a thing to enter the
gate;” and without troubling himself with further
investigation, the nobleman entered into his house.
As he did so, he turned to his butler—“Let covers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
be laid for three,” he said, in a tone of command;
“and give the housekeeper notice that the Duke of
Montleroy is likely to be here at luncheon.”</p>

<p>“Covers are laid already for four, by her ladyship’s
order,” said the butler.</p>

<p>“Indeed! what guests are expected?” asked the
earl.</p>

<p>“The lady and gentleman, my lord, who came in
the chaise, and who are now in the drawing-room,”
was the reply.</p>

<p>The earl stalked into the library in a state, not
only of high irritation and annoyance, but also of
considerable perplexity. Annabella had never before
appeared to him so utterly regardless of his wishes
and feelings, so completely destitute of a sense of
what was due to her position. To invite low
people—for such, he thought, that her guests assuredly
must be—to share her meal, to be introduced
to her husband, it was an offence scarcely to
be forgiven! And what was to be done on the
present occasion? Dashleigh had, on that morning,
casually met and invited a duke! It would be impossible
to insult a man of his quality by making
him sit at the same table with such <i lang="fr">canaille</i>! The
idea of such a breach of etiquette was abhorrent to
the feelings of the aristocrat, and yet, how was the
reality to be avoided? Annabella had invited her
own friends, and the earl was too much of a gentleman
to be willing to commit any decided breach of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
courtesy towards his wife’s guests, even though they
might have come in a donkey conveyance.</p>

<p>We talk of the <em>petty</em> miseries of pride; to Dashleigh
the misery was not petty. It was with feelings
of serious annoyance that he rang his library bell,
and bade the servant who answered it request his
lady to speak with the earl directly.</p>

<p>The message was carried to Annabella while she
was pursuing with the doctor a playful argument on
some literary question.</p>

<p>“Is the earl aware that I am engaged with guests?”
asked the incautious countess.</p>

<p>“His lordship knows who is here,” replied the
servant.</p>

<p>Annabella instantly perceived her mistake, for she
saw the blood mount to the cheek of the sensitive
old Doctor. His pride was evidently on the <i lang="fr">qui vive</i>;
and it served to awaken hers. The countess felt
somewhat disposed to return to her liege lord such
an answer as Horatio received from his widow. She
had no inclination to play Griselda in the presence of
her early friends. She contented herself, however,
with showing that she was in no haste to obey the
summons of her titled husband, and finished her discussion
before (after apologizing to the Bardons for
a brief absence) she proceeded to the library, where
her indignant lord was impatiently awaiting her.</p>

<p>Dr. Bardon walked up to the window with his
hands behind him, and waited for a space in silence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
Cecilia saw by the motion of his feet that a storm
was brewing in the air. Presently he turned
suddenly round with the question: “Do you suppose
that this earl means to make his appearance?”</p>

<p>“Ye-e-es,” replied Cecilia timidly.</p>

<p>“No!” exclaimed the doctor fiercely. The two
words, and the manner of pronouncing them, were
characteristic of father and daughter, and might
almost have been adopted as mottoes by the twain.
“Yes” was very often on Cecilia’s lips, but she appeared
to feel the affirmation too short to answer the
full purpose of politeness, and always managed to
drawl out the monosyllable to the length of three.
Bardon’s “No,” on the contrary, came out short and
sharp, like a bark. He seemed to concentrate into
it his haughty spirit of perpetual dissent from the
opinions of the rest of the world.</p>

<p>“I should not wonder if the poor girl has got
into a scrape for inviting us,” was the doctor’s next
observation.</p>

<p>“Oh! dear papa!” exclaimed Cecilia, in an expostulatory
tone, though the same thought had just been
passing through her own mind.</p>

<p>“I’m not going to wait here like a lackey in a
lobby!” said the doctor, moving towards the door.
Cecilia was in a tremour of apprehension.</p>

<p>“Papa, papa! we can’t slip away without bidding
the countess good-bye,—without seeing the earl,—it
would look so odd, so rude.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>“What’s odd and rude is their leaving us here,
without paying us common civility! I’ll stand it no
longer!” cried the irascible man; and opening the
door, he proceeded along the corridor which led to
the hall, followed by his expostulating daughter.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, their course lay past the library;
and more unfortunately still, the library door happened
to be very slightly ajar.</p>

<p>“Can’t you manage some way of getting rid of
these miserable Bardons?” were the words, pronounced
in an irritated tone, which struck like a
pistol-shot on the ears of the countess’s guests.</p>

<p>It was as though that pistol-shot had exploded a
mine of gunpowder! To the earl’s amazement the
library door was suddenly flung wide open, and,
quivering with irrepressible rage, the fiery old doctor
stood before him.</p>

<p>“Manage!” exclaimed Bardon, in a voice of
thunder; “there is little <em>management</em> required in
dismissing those who, had they known the despicable
pride which inhabits here, would never have stooped,—<em>never
have stooped</em>,” he repeated, “to degrade
themselves by crossing your threshold! You have
dared to apply to us the epithet of <em>miserable</em>,” continued
Bardon, bringing out the word as with a
convulsive effort, and fixing his fierce eye upon the
disconcerted peer; “I retort back the opprobrious
term! Who is miserable but the miserable slave of
pride,—the worshipper of rank, the gilded puppet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
of society, who claims from his ancestors’ name the
importance which attaches to nothing of his own?
This is the first time, sir, that I have visited you,
and it shall be the last,—the last time that you shall
have the opportunity of insulting, under your own
roof, a gentleman whose pretensions to respect are,
at least, as well grounded as yours, and who would
not exchange his independence of spirit for all the
pomp and pageantry which can never give dignity
to their possessor, nor avert from him merited contempt!”
With the last words on his lips, Bardon
turned and departed; his loud, tramping step
echoing along the hall, before the earl had time to
recover his breath.</p>

<p>Annabella, agitated and excited, appeared about
to hurry after her guests, but with an imperious
gesture Dashleigh prevented his wife from doing so.
Bitterly mortified at what had occurred, irritated,
wounded, and offended, the countess burst into a
flood of passionate tears.</p>

<p>Pride reigned triumphant that day in the Hall.
He had worked out his evil will. He had steeped
hearts in bitter gall; he had loosened the bond
between husband and wife; he had brought envy,
hatred, malice, and all uncharitableness, to rush in at
the breach which he had insidiously made.</p>

<p>The countess spent the rest of the day in her own
apartment. She would not appear at her husband’s
table, nor entertain her husband’s guest. She had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
not learned to bear or to forbear; least of all was
she prepared to submit her will to that of her imperious
lord. Even when the breach between them
appeared to be healed, it left its visible scar behind;
the wound was ready to break out afresh, for the
soft balm of meekness and love had not been poured
upon it, and what else can effectually cure the hurt
caused by the envenomed shaft of pride?</p>

<p>The red glow of sunset had ceased to light up the
latticed windows of the vicarage, or bathe its smooth
lawn and thick shrubbery in a crimson glow. The
rosy tint of the sky had faded into grey, and the
evening mist had begun to rise, but still the vicar
prolonged his walk on the gravel path in front of his
dwelling. Up and down he slowly paced, with his
hands behind him, his eyes bent on the ground, and
an expression of thought—painful thought—upon
his benevolent face. Ida passed him on her return
from a class, but, contrary to his usual habit, he
took no notice of his daughter. Mabel tripped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
through the open window,—a mode of exit which she
usually preferred to the door,—and, running lightly up
to her father, locked her arm within his, with a playful
remark on his solitary mood. The remark did not
call up an answering smile; Mr. Aumerle did not
appear even to have heard it, so Mabel, concluding
from his manner that he must be composing a
funeral sermon, quietly left him to his grave meditations.</p>

<p>At length, with a little sigh, as if he had just
arrived at the conclusion of some painful line of
reflection, the clergyman turned towards the house,
and entering at the door, made his way towards his
own little study.</p>

<p>As he had expected, the room was not empty.
His brother sat reading at the table by the light of
a lamp, which threw into strong relief the classic
outline of his handsome features. Aumerle saw not—no
mortal could see—the dim, dark form beside
him, or mark the gigantic shadow cast over the
reader by the bat-like wing extended over him by
Pride.</p>

<p>Mr. Aumerle sat down near Augustine in silence.
He surveyed his brother some moments with a look
of anxious tenderness, then gave a little cough, as if
to arouse his attention.</p>

<p>Augustine glanced up from the volume of German
philosophy which he had been perusing. He had
perhaps an idea that something unpleasant was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
coming, for he did not choose to commence the conversation.</p>

<p>“My dear Augustine,” began Lawrence Aumerle,
after another uneasy little cough, “I have been for
some time wishing to speak to you on a subject of
great interest to us both. You must be aware,—you
cannot but feel that the light observation which
escaped you to-day at dinner, was of a nature to
give me considerable pain.”</p>

<p>“What I said about the Bible?” replied his
brother. “Well, it was a thoughtless observation, I
own; but I certainly never intended to pain you.
Your good lady came down upon me so sharp, and
gave me such an oratorical cudgelling, that even Ida
herself must have confessed that the punishment
exceeded the offence.”</p>

<p>“Augustine, this is no jesting matter,” said his
brother.</p>

<p>“I own that I was indiscreet and wrong in talking
after that fashion in presence of the girls. Are you
not satisfied with that frank confession?”</p>

<p>“I am not satisfied; I cannot be satisfied while I
remain in doubt as to whether those careless words
did not really express the opinion of my brother.
Ever since you have been here on this visit, Augustine,
it has seemed to me as if a change had passed
over you; you are no longer what you once were.
There is not the frank interchange of thought between
us that there used to be in former years.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am no longer a boy,” replied Augustine, leaning
carelessly back in his chair.</p>

<p>“When you were a boy,” continued Mr. Aumerle,
“you used often to express to me your desire to
enter the ministry.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all over,” replied Augustine quickly;
“my views on many points have changed. I have
discovered that there are many paths open to speculative
thought besides the dry beaten one which you
and all the pious world have been content for generations
to tread.”</p>

<p>“There is nothing,” murmured Pride, “so hateful
to an exalted spirit as travelling in a crowd.”</p>

<p>“Is it well,” said Aumerle, “to wander from the
narrow path, in which so many have found happiness
in life, and peace in death?”</p>

<p>“There are stumbling-blocks in that path,” replied
Augustine; “difficulties which it would puzzle even
a theologian like yourself to remove, and over which
the learned and the zealous have wrangled from time
immemorial. How can you explain to me this?”
and the young man ran over, with rapid eloquence,
one after another of the difficult questions which
have for ages put human wisdom to fault. “How
can you explain all this?” he repeated, at the close
of his argument.</p>

<p>“These things are beyond the grasp of the human
mind,” replied the clergyman; “they are not contrary
to reason, but above it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>“Reason is the guide allotted to intellectual
man,” said Augustine; “I go as far as she leads me,
and no further.”</p>

<p>“Reason is the guide that leads to the temple of
revelation. There is an overwhelming mass of
evidence, external and internal, to convince any unprejudiced
mind that the Bible is the word of God.
Prophecies accomplished, types fulfilled, the divine
Spirit breathed through the pages, the unearthly
perfection of One character there portrayed, with
superhuman knowledge of the frailties and requirements
of man; the devotion of the early witnesses
to its truth, who sealed their testimony with their
blood; the standing miracles foretold in the Scriptures,
of the Jewish people scattered amongst all
nations, and yet separate, and of a Church which,
rising in an obscure land from the tomb of its
Founder, has spread against the opposition of earth
and hell, has swept away the barriers raised against
it by temporal power and spiritual idolatry, and the
natural opposition of every unregenerate heart, and
which still goes on conquering and to conquer;—is
not all this sufficient to bring reason to the position
of the handmaid of religion, and make her, as I
said at the first, the guide to the temple of revelation?”</p>

<p>“Granted,” said Augustine, after a pause; “but,
when we enter that temple, when we scrutinize the
mysteries which it contains—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>“Reason is no longer capable of guiding the soul;
the appointed guardian of these mysteries is faith.”</p>

<p>“Who would lead us blindfold!” said Augustine
impatiently. “Here it is that I would make my
stand, for I maintain that no man—”</p>

<p><i>Pride.</i>—“Gifted, intellectual man—”</p>

<p><i>Augustine.</i>—“Is bound to believe what he cannot
understand!”</p>

<p><i>Aumerle.</i>—“Augustine, Augustine, all nature refutes
you! What do we understand of the physical
wonders that have environed man for thousands of
years? We note facts, but in what innumerable instances
are we baffled when we attempt to trace back
effects to their causes! We hear the power of
electricity in the thunder-clap, see it in the flash of
lightning, nay, make it the servant of our will to
unite distant continents together; but who can say
that he understands it? We give it a name, we calculate
its force, but reason grasps not its nature.
Who can say how the soul is united to the body?
Who can say what the faculty of memory may be,
where it hoards up its life-accumulated treasures, and
produces on the moment from the mass the very
idea which it requires? These are not foreign subjects,
they are subjects brought daily to the attention
of myriads of reasoning beings, and during sixty
centuries what has reason made of them? She is content
to give up her place to faith; we believe, but we
<em>cannot</em> understand. And can we expect that aught<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
else should be the case when a weak, helpless worm
like man fixes his thoughts upon the solemn mysteries
of the invisible world,—when the finite attempts
to comprehend the infinite! Reason, your boasted
reason, at once shows the folly of such an expectation.
On this earth we are in the infancy of our
existence. As little could the young child of a monarch,
while scarcely yet able to read, expect to grasp
the difficult science of administration, and make himself
master of the details of the business of an empire,
as man, with his limited faculties, fathom the
deep things of God!”</p>

<p>“In this your favourite simile,” said Augustine,
“you must admit that some children are more advanced
than the rest.”</p>

<p>“I believe that he is most advanced in spiritual
knowledge,” replied Aumerle, “who can adopt the
language of the gifted warrior-king of Israel.” He
opened the Bible which lay on the table, and read
aloud from the 131st Psalm:—</p>

<p>“<em>Lord, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes
lofty: neither do I exercise myself in great matters,
or in things too high for me. Surely I have behaved
and quieted myself, as a child that is weaned
of his mother: my soul is even as a weaned child.</em>”</p>

<p>“One would almost think,” observed Augustine,
“that you consider intellect as rather a disqualification
than a help in penetrating the mysteries of religion.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>“These mysteries are beyond the province allotted
to human intellect,” replied his brother. “The Bible
assures us that <em>the natural man receiveth not the
things of God, for they are spiritually discerned</em>.
Our Lord thanked his Father that these things, being
hidden <em>from the wise and prudent</em> (wise in the
world’s wisdom, prudent in their own eyes), were yet
<em>revealed unto babes</em>. Depend upon it, my dear
brother,” continued the clergyman earnestly, “the
true stumbling-block in our path is our pride! Is it
not written in the word, <em>The meek will he guide in
judgment, and the meek will he teach his way</em>?”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to assert,” said Augustine, “that
none of the meek and devout have ever been troubled
with difficulties and doubts?”</p>

<p>“Not so; I believe that many of God’s best servants
have been much exercised with such spiritual
trials. But it has been beautifully written, ‘A sign
is granted to the doubt of love which is not given to
the doubt of indifference.’ The meek are not left
in darkness,—such are not given up to the adversary.
But it is because they oppose him, not in the
intellectual armour of subtle reasoning and metaphysical
argument, but armed with the sling of prayer,
humble and persevering prayer. To such the promise
of the Comforter is given, whose office is to
guide unto all truth.’”</p>

<p><i>Augustine.</i>—“You, doubtless, are amongst those
spiritually enlightened, though I suspect that you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
regard me as still in darkness. I should like to
know how far, with faith your infallible guide, you
have penetrated into such a mystery, for instance, as
that of the origin of sin.”</p>

<p><i>Pride.</i>—“Nail him with that difficulty; wrest his
one weapon out of his hand, and see how he comes
off in the contest when your intellect fairly grapples
with his!”</p>

<p><i>Aumerle.</i>—“I find it more profitable, my brother,
to trace the effects of sin in my own heart, than to
dive into such a mystery. The existence of sin within
us concerns us more nearly than its origin.”</p>

<p><i>Augustine.</i>—“Now own to me frankly, Lawrence,
whether there be not something conventional and
strained in this perpetual talk—I had almost said
<em>cant</em>—about sin, which we hear from the best people
in the world? I look upon it as the affectation of
humility, because without that crowning virtue the
most saintly character is not considered to be absolutely
perfect.”</p>

<p><i>Aumerle.</i>—“Can you doubt the all-pervading influence
of sin? <em>The heart is deceitful above all
things and desperately wicked. All our righteousnesses
are as filthy rags. There is none that doeth
good, no not one</em>; this is the scriptural estimate of
human nature.”</p>

<p><i>Augustine.</i>—“Lay aside the Scriptures for a
moment, and come to actual facts as we see them
around us. Look now at such a character as that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
Ida—pure, unworldly, self-denying, devoted; such a
description of evil cannot for a moment be applied
to her.”</p>

<p><i>Aumerle.</i>—“You see her, God be praised, as she is
by grace, and not by nature.”</p>

<p><i>Augustine.</i>—“But she continues to regard herself
as a sinner,—for aught that I know as the chief of
sinners, she is ever repenting of errors which no one
but herself can perceive.”</p>

<p><i>Aumerle.</i>—“With faculties as limited as ours, our
not perceiving errors is no proof of their non-existence.
What to the naked eye is so pure as a crystal
stream, or so glorious as the orb of day? yet the microscope
reveals to us impurities in the water, and the
telescope—blots in the sun.”</p>

<p><i>Augustine (smiling).</i>—“Leave to me the unassisted
vision. I do not wish to think ill of human nature.
I believe that a man may walk serenely through life,
and find himself in heaven at the end of it, without
this incessant judging and condemning either himself
or his fellow-creatures.”</p>

<p><i>Pride.</i>—“Yes; one who is like yourself possesses
an unblemished character, and a high moral standard,
and who seeks to benefit his kind, without professions
of superior sanctity.”</p>

<p><i>Aumerle.</i>—“Augustine, I see but too clearly why
your mind delights to seek out only the difficulties
and doubts in religion! You can sit tranquilly as a
judge, because you have never recognised your position<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
as a criminal. You are, with all your brilliant
intellect, ignorant of the very alphabet of spiritual
knowledge. You do not know your own weakness
and sin.”</p>

<p><i>Pride.</i>—“He imagines himself addressing one of
the ignorant rustics of his parish. His mind is narrowed
by professional bigotry. It requires at least
the virtue of patience to listen to such illiberal cant.”</p>

<p><i>Augustine (smiling).</i>—“It seems, Lawrence, that
you would have me acknowledge myself not only a
child, but a very naughty child.”</p>

<p><i>Aumerle.</i>—“Augustine, this is no subject for trifling.
The difference between our ages long made me
regard you rather as a beloved son than a brother.
In some points our relative positions may be reversed.
You have shown yourself to be possessed of talents to
which I can lay no claim; I cheerfully cede to you
the palm in all that regards intellectual power. But
in one thing riper years still give me the advantage.
Experience is the natural growth of time; spiritual
experience of self-examination and prayer. I am
persuaded that every step of the Christian’s life
opens to him a wider prospect of the evil of his sinful
nature. He learns it not only from the Bible,
but by painful remembrance of broken resolutions,
neglected duties, and secret backslidings, even if the
Almighty preserve him from falls visible to others.
Spiritual pride, nay, all pride, can be but the offspring
of ignorance, ignorance of the requirements of God’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
law, and of our failure in fulfilling that law,—ignorance
of the infinite holiness of the Creator, and of
the infirmity and guilt of the creature!”</p>

<p>Pride started at the words of Aumerle, and fiercely
shook his sable wing. The earnestness and tenderness
of the clergyman’s manner might have made
some impression on his brother, but Pride threw
himself between them, and laid an iron grasp on his
slave. Oh, how difficult is it to speak rebuke, without
arousing the demon of Pride, and arming his giant
strength against us!</p>

<p>Augustine rose from his seat, and said coldly,
“Lawrence, we have had enough of this, and more
than enough. Thanks for your well-meant sermon,
though it savours more of the musty volumes of old
divinity, than the enlightened systems of an age of
progress. You and I will never look upon these
matters in the same light; let the subject be dropped
henceforth between us!” And so saying, and taking
with him his philosophical book, Augustine Aumerle
quitted the study.</p>

<p>The vicar remained behind, sad, disappointed,
almost disheartened. His words appeared to have
had no effect but that of irritating his brother, and
weakening the bond between them. But Aumerle
had another resource, and he failed not to avail
himself of it. While Augustine in the drawing-room
was amusing himself and delighting his nieces
by a playful critique upon Tennyson’s poetry (theology<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
he had determined carefully to avoid entering upon
again at the vicarage), Lawrence was upon his knees
in his study, fervently imploring his heavenly Father
to open the eyes of one who appeared to be gifted
with all knowledge except that which could alone
make him <em>wise unto salvation</em>!</p>

<p>Perhaps the minister’s present failure was to
himself a blessing. It was sent to humble and prove
him, to make him feel how powerless he was to
influence a single soul without the aid of God’s Holy
Spirit. It made him more earnest in prayer, more
fervent in supplication. How many in a better
world may find that they have reason to thank God,
not only for their successes, but their failures, and
see that the blessings which they had invoked upon
others, had been returned a hundred-fold into their
own bosoms!</p>

<p>The Countess of Dashleigh sat in her boudoir,
surrounded by all the luxuries which art can devise
or wealth procure. But she paid little attention to
anything around her, for her thoughts were absorbed
in her occupation,—to a young authoress a very
delightful occupation,—that of revising the proof-sheets
of her first romance. “Egeria” was now
taking a flight above the columns of a periodical;
she was about to present to the world a volume in
violet and gold! How to give her ideas the richest
setting, how to display her talent to most advantage,
was now the one prevailing thought which occupied
her mind from morning till night. Annabella was
like a mother rejoicing over a first-born child; and
she examined the rough proofs with the interest and
delight which a young parent might feel in surveying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
the little elegancies of the wardrobe of her darling
babe.</p>

<p>“Egeria” smiled to herself as she imagined the
various reviews of her work which would doubtless
appear in the papers and periodicals of the day.
She fancied what passages would be extracted, what
characters praised; what might possibly be censured,
what must be admired. In the midst of her enjoyment
of this feast of imagination, she was interrupted
by the entrance of the earl. Alas! that the presence
of a husband should ever be felt unwelcome!</p>

<p>“Annabella, my love, I have just received a letter,
which I should be obliged by your answering for me.
I am glad to find you with a pen in your hand.”</p>

<p>“Presently, Reginald; I will answer it presently,”
said the countess, a slight frown of impatience passing
over her brow; “I am most exceedingly busy at
present.”</p>

<p>“What are you doing?” inquired the earl, who
was not in the secret of his lady’s occupation, though
aware that she devoted much time to her pen.
“May I see?” he added, taking up one of the dirty
proof-sheets which had just received Annabella’s
corrections.</p>

<p>“Are you to be my first critic?” said the countess
playfully; “if so, I hope that you will be an indulgent
one.”</p>

<p>The earl looked for a few minutes a little embarrassed,
as if a subject had been suddenly brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
before him on which he had not had time to make
up his mind. He then seated himself on the sofa,
and twisting the paper about in his fingers as he
addressed his wife without looking at her, he began
in his somewhat formal style:—“It seems to me,
Annabella, that authorship is not what is most
exactly suitable for one who holds the position of a
countess.”</p>

<p>“Are countesses then supposed to be more stupid
than other people?” asked Annabella.</p>

<p>The earl made no direct reply to a question which
appeared to him rather impertinent. He was
desirous to avoid an argument, and rather to have
recourse to persuasion. “You have so many other
resources,” he began, “so many pleasures—”</p>

<p>“Not one of them,—not all of them together to be
compared to this!” exclaimed Annabella with animation.
“I value the smallest bay-leaf from Parnassus
more than the strawberry-leaves on a ducal coronet!”</p>

<p>The Earl of Dashleigh was offended. “I am
aware, madam,” he said stiffly, “that you take a
pride in disparaging the advantages of high social
standing. A lofty position has no charms for you.”</p>

<p>“I have known the time, Dashleigh,” said his
wife, laughing, but with something of bitterness in
her mirth, “when a lofty position had no charms for
you. When you stood upon a certain Swiss mountain,
able neither to get upwards nor downwards,
and glad of the assistance of my little hand—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>“That has nothing on earth to do with the
question!” cried the earl, colouring and looking
angry.</p>

<p>“Oh! I beg your lordship’s pardon; I was going
to draw an analogy, as the learned say; I was going
to make a metaphor of a fact. I looked at snowy
peaks, deep abysses, awful chasms, and was transported
with a sense of their grandeur, as you are
with that of hereditary rank! Mont Blanc seemed
to me loftier—more sublime—than the woolsack
appears to you! You, on the contrary, grew a little
dizzy,—you only considered the fatigue of the climbing,
and the danger—”</p>

<p>“This is idle talk!” cried the earl impatiently.
“I happened to be taken with a fit of vertigo, and—and
of course you have no intention of publishing?”
he inquired, making a very abrupt turn in
the conversation.</p>

<p>“Of course I have,” replied Annabella.</p>

<p>“You do not mean to—to let me infer for a
moment that you, the Countess of Dashleigh, have
ever dreamed of deriving any pecuniary advantage—”
The words appeared almost to choke him, so he left
the sentence incomplete.</p>

<p>“You do not suppose that I intend to make a
present to the publisher of the effusions of my
genius,” said the lady. “No, I have the pleasure
of working for a good cause. The new gallery of
our church is to be propped up by this little pen!”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
and with some pride Annabella held upright on the
table the small instrument of her literary power.</p>

<p>“Really, madam, you astonish me!” exclaimed
the peer, rising in surprise and indignation. “The
Countess of Dashleigh to enter the lists with Grub
Street penny-a-liners,—the Countess of Dashleigh
to receive payment from a publisher, to earn a
miserable pittance like any wretched mechanic—”</p>

<p>“To do what Shakspeare, Milton, Johnson, did
before her.”</p>

<p>“They were not of the peerage,” interrupted
Dashleigh.</p>

<p>“No, they were something more!” exclaimed
Annabella. “They were ‘below the good how far;
but <em>far above the great</em>!’ I should be only too
proud to follow in their steps!”</p>

<p>“I tell you it is impossible,—utterly impossible,”
repeated the earl. “My wife to work for hire! I
could never show my face again in the House of
Lords if I submitted to such a degradation!”</p>

<p>Poor Annabella was like a child whose high-built
house of cards has been suddenly dashed to the
ground. Her eyes filled fast with tears, but she
was too proud to let them overflow.</p>

<p>The earl was not a hard man. He saw that he
had given pain, and hastened to smoothe down his
young wife’s disappointment.</p>

<p>“Since writing gives you such amusement,” he
said, “I will not altogether discourage it. You may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
print that work for private circulation—I have no
great objection to that—and as for the gallery of the
church, I will support that by a handsome donation.”</p>

<p>Dashleigh thought that this concession must
entirely satisfy Annabella, but in this he showed
little knowledge of the peculiar ambition of his wife.
What! was she never to see a review of her work
in a leading paper,—was she to limit its circulation,—were
a few friends and acquaintance alone to
enjoy what she had expected would excite a sensation
throughout the literary world! This would be
clipping the wings of her Pegasus indeed, and making
him the mere carriage-horse of a peer!</p>

<p>“I would rather burn my volume at once,” she
said pettishly, “than have it merely printed for private
circulation. I should be ashamed to send it
round like a begging-box to my acquaintance, with
an understood petition of ‘compliments thankfully
received!’”</p>

<p>“You could not endure to see your book hawked
about, sold on miserable stalls, thumbed in circulating
libraries!”</p>

<p>The idea was shocking to the earl, but very delightful
to Annabella. “I could endure it very
well,” she said coldly; “I see no harm in the thing.”</p>

<p>“But I see it, madam,” exclaimed Dashleigh, “and
what’s more, I will not suffer it to be done! Your
dignity is connected with my own; it may be nothing
to you, but it is something to me. If my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
wishes have no effect, you will at least listen to my
commands.”</p>

<p>“Tyrant!” whispered the demon Pride; and the
heart of Annabella echoed the treasonous word
‘tyrant!’</p>

<p>The earl was satisfied with having taken a step
so decided. He had no wish to prolong a discussion
with his wife, in which, as he knew by experience,
she generally had the advantage. Having uttered
his mandate he quitted the room, leaving Annabella
in a state of angry excitement.</p>

<p>“Private circulation! I may print for private circulation!
most condescending concession from my
lord!” she muttered to herself, as she sat gloomily
surveying the proofs which had lately afforded her
such keen delight. Then a thought seemed at once
to strike the countess, her over-cast countenance
lighted up with a gleam as if of triumph. “Yes; I
will write something for private circulation,” she
cried, “something which my lord will find so very
amusing, so highly diverting, that he will be glad to
compound for its suppression by letting me do what
I like with my book. Mine shall be a little romance
in real life, an incident in the life of a peer of the
realm!” and, dashing the drops from her eyes, Annabella
at once sat down to her desk.</p>

<p>She wrote in a fit of resentment, and what she
penned naturally took the colour of her feelings.
The countess wrote a ludicrous account of a little adventure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
which had occurred to the Earl of ——, the
dash serving as a transparent veil which every one
could see through. She recounted how the earl, accompanied
by his wife, who was fired with the ambition
of emulating the feats which Albert Smith has
rendered famous, ascended part of the way up a
Swiss mountain. She described how, long ere the
snowy region was reached, the nobleman had been
seized with giddiness and nervous fear; how he had
stood on a steep slope, with a precipice on either
hand, clutching tremblingly at the rock-plants which
gave way in his grasp, calling out in alarm for aid,
and thankful at last to catch hold of the end of a
boa which his more active and fearless partner extended
from the summit of a cliff. It was a relief
to Annabella to give vent to her anger and malice
in this little, humorous sketch. She wrote without
any deliberate intention of ever showing it to a
human eye; her paper took to her the place of a
female confidante, that too often mischievous companion
to a woman who is not happily married.</p>

<p>Having finished her little piece the countess descended
to the drawing-room, to pass a sullen, uncomfortable
evening in the society of her aristocratic
husband.</p>

<p>It was a sunny afternoon in April. In a rustic arbour
at the end of the garden, garlanded with honeysuckle
and clematis, through the interstices of whose
bright, young leaves came the smiling sunshine, and
the soft breath of Spring, sat Ida and Mabel Aumerle.
This arbour was a favourite retreat of the girls;
thither they carried their books and their work;
and could the clustering shrubs around it have had
a voice, much could they have told of sweet converse
held together by the sisters, and that free interchange
of thought which is one of the dearest privileges of
friendship.</p>

<p>“Ida, dearest,” said Mabel, “shall I tell you what
Uncle Augustine said of you to-day when you left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
the room after prayers? He said, ‘Ida is a noble
girl, and has no fault except that of being too good.’
Papa smiled and shook his head gently; Mrs. Aumerle
gave her odious, little shrug!”</p>

<p>“Uncle Augustine does not know my heart,” said
Ida.</p>

<p>“But I know it if any one does, and I am sure
that uncle himself cannot think more highly of you
than I do.”</p>

<p>“You are partial,” replied her sister with a smile.</p>

<p>“I only wish that I were like you! I know I’m
a proud, wayward girl, and shall never reach heaven
unless I am better. I often make good resolutions,
but somehow”—Mabel looked down sadly as she
spoke,—“somehow they break away like thread in
the flame! I wonder if I shall ever be really holy.”</p>

<p>Ida laid down the muslin which she was working,
and drawing closer to her young sister, said in a
gentle tone, “You speak, dearest, of being holy and
reaching heaven; of making good resolutions and not
being able to keep them,—as if the impression were
on your mind that you have to form, as it were, a
ladder of good works, by which to reach a certain
difficult height, beyond which lie the regions of
glory.”</p>

<p>“That’s just it,” said Mabel sadly, “and I am discouraged
because I always find that my ladder is too
short; that climb as I may, I never can reach the
height that you do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>“I threw away my ladder long ago,” said Ida
clasping her hands; “I found that every round in it
was broken!”</p>

<p>“O Ida, what do you mean? I am certain that
you have never ceased to do good works daily.”</p>

<p>“I would no more use them,” exclaimed Ida, “as <em>a
means of reaching heaven</em>, than I would hope, by aid
of yonder fragile clematis, to climb to the bright sun
or stars! No,” she continued, her lip trembling with
emotion as she spoke, “I would put those works which
you call good, to the only use for which they are fit;
if the fire of love kindle the broken, imperfect fragments,
I may humbly offer upon them a sacrifice of
thanksgiving to Him through whom alone I have
hope of reaching the heavenly heights.”</p>

<p>“But, Ida, I can hardly yet see how <em>every round</em>
on the ladder of good works is broken. I am sure
that some—at least of <em>yours</em>, must be very pleasing
to God.”</p>

<p>“Let us examine them closely,” replied Ida, “let
us fix upon what you consider the very best of our
works, and let us see if it could, even for a moment,
in itself support the weight of a soul.”</p>

<p>Mabel considered for a little, and then said, “Perhaps
the best of our works is prayer.”</p>

<p>“We shall not need much examination, I fear, to
find that our prayers are cold, wandering, insincere.”</p>

<p>“Cold sometimes, yes,—but—”</p>

<p>“And sadly wandering,” added Ida; “at least I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
am sure that I feel mine to be so. O Mabel! I have
often reflected that if an angel could write down all
the thoughts that flow through our minds while we
kneel in the attitude of prayer,—the foolish fancies,
the idle dreams, the vain selfish imaginations which
mix with our earnest supplications, we should be so
shocked and disgusted at such a mockery of devotion,
that with penitence and shame we should implore
that our prayers themselves should be forgiven!”</p>

<p>“Yes; they are cold and wandering,—but I am
sure that mine are not insincere.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid that we sometimes ask for blessings
which we have no earnest desire to obtain. Do we
not sometimes pray to be delivered from pride and
uncharitableness, when at the time we are fostering
these enemies as welcome guests in our hearts?
Have we fully entered into the spirit of that prayer
which we have so often uttered:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘The dearest idol I have known,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Whate’er that idol be,</div>
<div class="verse">Help me to tear it from thy throne,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And worship only Thee?’</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>If we were quite certain that such prayers would
be granted <em>directly</em>, would we not sometimes be
afraid to breathe them, and is there then no insincerity
in having them so frequently on our lips?”</p>

<p>“O Ida!” exclaimed Mabel, with a sigh; “you
look a great deal too closely into the heart! If our
very prayers be full of sin, what must our worldly
actions be? The most disagreeable duty in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
world is this searching for hidden evil, this dreadful
self-examination! I am sure that a great many
good people never practise it, and are much happier
for their ignorance of themselves.”</p>

<p>“What should we say, dear one, of a man of business
who refused to look into his books, lest he
should find the balance against him? of the owner
of a dwelling who should be content to keep one
room swept and cleansed, leaving all the rest, with
locked doors and closed shutters, to darkness and pollution?
what should we think of the governor of a
castle, who should pace proudly along the battlements,
careless whether a lurking foe had not penetrated
to the heart of the fortress?”</p>

<p>“I should certainly think the two first fools, and
the third a traitor to his trust,” replied Mabel. “But,
Ida, this self-examination only makes us miserable!
If I find every round in my ladder broken, and have
my fierce enemy behind me, and before me the
heights which I shall never be able to reach,—what
can I do but sit down and despair?”</p>

<p>“You forget, you forget,” cried Ida, with animation,
“the bright golden cord which is let down to
you from above. We cannot climb to heaven by our
good works; but faith, living, loving faith, can grasp
the means of salvation held out by a merciful
Saviour. The more helpless we feel ourselves, the
more eagerly we cling to our only sure hope. Mabel,
this is the glory of the Gospel. It humbles the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
sinner, but exalts the Saviour; it shows us that we
can do nothing in ourselves, yet can do all things
through Him who loved and gave himself for us!”</p>

<p>Mabel made no reply in words, but she drooped
her head till it found its resting-place on a sister’s
bosom. An arm was gently drawn around her,
and Ida imprinted a silent kiss on her brow.
The demon Pride stood gloomily aloof; he felt himself
baffled for a time, and dared not intrude his
presence on the sisters during the remainder of that
peaceful day!</p>

<p>The Earl and Countess of Dashleigh now found less
enjoyment in the mutual converse which had once
made their days flow so pleasantly and swiftly, and
which had been especially appreciated by Dashleigh,
whose reserve or pride made him avoid much general
society. When Annabella’s wit sparkled before him,
he had needed no other amusement, and in the first
part of her wedded life, she had required no other
auditor than him who listened with so partial an ear.
But each now felt that a change had come, as water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
penetrating the crevices of a rock, and then freezing,
sometimes by its sudden expansion bursts asunder
the solid stone, and severs it as effectually by silent
power as a gunpowder blast could have done, so
secret pride in both hearts was gradually, fatally
dividing those bound to each other by the closest of
earthly ties! There was yet, however, no open
quarrel; the world was not called in as a spectator of
domestic disunion. There was no appearance of want
of harmony as, on the occasion which I am about to
relate, the husband and the wife sat together in the
countess’s luxurious boudoir, Annabella on a damask
sofa, engaged in German work, the earl at a writing-table,
looking over a copy of the <cite>Times</cite>.</p>

<p>There had been a long silence between them. It
was broken by a question from Dashleigh.</p>

<p>“Did you know, Annabella, that Augustine Aumerle
was soon going to leave the vicarage and return
to Aspendale?”</p>

<p>“I know little of what goes on at the vicarage,”
replied Annabella, after pausing to count stitches in
her pattern; “I think that Ida must have cut me,
she so seldom comes to the hall.”</p>

<p>“There are to be great doings at Aspendale,” resumed
Dashleigh; “I saw Augustine this morning
during my ride, and he told me of his novel arrangements.
He expects soon a visit from Verdon, the
well-known æronaut; I wonder that he keeps up
acquaintance with one who may be regarded as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
public exhibitor; but that is his business, not mine;
it seems that they were school-fellows together, and
it is not easy to break off old friendships.”</p>

<p>“If there be such a thing as a <em>lofty</em> profession it is
Mr. Verdon’s, without doubt,” said Annabella; “the
aspirations of an æronaut must mount higher than
even those of a peer!”</p>

<p>“It appears,” continued Dashleigh, without seeming
to take notice of the observation, “that Mr. Verdon
is to give his new grand balloon a trial trip from
Augustine’s grounds.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how I should like to be there!” cried the
countess.</p>

<p>“Augustine has invited us both,”—Annabella
clapped her hands like a child,—“but the difficulty
is that he will not be able himself to do the honours
of his house, as he is to accompany Verdon in his
upward flight.”</p>

<p>“Is he?” exclaimed the young countess; “that
will be charming! Such a genius will mount up so
high, that the silken ball will have no need of hydrogen
gas! He will but inflate it with poetical ideas,
and it will never stop short of the stars!”</p>

<p>The earl smiled at the idea. “I should be well
pleased to see the ascent,” he observed; “but yet I
am doubtful about accepting the invitation. It
would, you see, be awkward for those in our position
of life to be guests at the table of a man who
was at the moment up in the clouds.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>Annabella burst into a girlish laugh. “You are
afraid that he might look down even upon us,” she
cried.</p>

<p>“I doubt whether etiquette would allow—”</p>

<p>“Throw etiquette to the dogs!” exclaimed Annabella,
heedless of her husband’s look of disgust at
such an audacious parody on Shakspeare. “I
must, will go to Aspendale! It will be such
fun! I have half a mind to ascend in the balloon
myself!”</p>

<p>“It would be very unsuitable for a lady,” began
the earl,—</p>

<p>“Unless her lord would accompany her,” said
Annabella, archly; “we might obtain as fine a view
as from Mont Blanc, without all the trouble of
climbing.”</p>

<p>The earl always winced under any allusion to his
mountain adventure.</p>

<p>“But then,” continued Annabella maliciously, “it
would never do to get giddy,—suspended between
earth and sky,—there would be no hope of the
friendly intervention of a lady’s boa!”</p>

<p>“I should not have the slightest objection, not
the slightest,” repeated the irritated earl, “to go
in a balloon to-morrow; indeed, I think it very
probable that I shall make one of Augustine’s
party.”</p>

<p>Annabella was diverted to see that she had succeeded
in putting her haughty lord on his mettle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
It seems an instinct with some natures to delight in
showing a power to tease, and it had become stronger
with the countess since her disappointment regarding
her romance. She was like a child playing with
fire-arms, ignorant of their dangerous nature. Annabella
knew the weakness of her husband’s nerves, but
not the full strength of his pride.</p>

<p>“I was reading yesterday a curious account of a
balloon ascent,” continued the earl, in a quieter tone;
“and, by-the-bye, I have not quite finished it. It
is in the —— Magazine; have you seen the last
number, Annabella?”</p>

<p>“I glanced over it,” replied the lady, carelessly;
“I suppose that it is lying on one of the tables.”</p>

<p>The earl rose and looked around for the magazine.
His wife was too busy in arranging the
shades for a withered rose-leaf to give him the least
assistance. She was too busy to notice that he at
length extended his search for the missing periodical
to the drawer of her writing-table. Into that drawer,
with habitual carelessness, the countess had thrust a
little manuscript, to which, after hastily writing it,
she had scarcely given a thought.</p>

<p>“What’s this?” exclaimed Dashleigh half aloud,
as his gaze unwittingly fell upon the title—“The
Precipice and the Peer.” The first glance had been
purely accidental, for the earl was above petty curiosity,
and would never have touched either paper or
drawer had he supposed them to contain anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
secret. But now an ungovernable impulse made
him open the leaves, and hastily run his eye over
the contents. Annabella had just succeeded in finding
a missing shade of russet, when she was startled
by a sudden sound resembling a stamp; and looking
up, she saw the earl with his very temples crimsoned
by rage, and her unfortunate burlesque in his
hand.</p>

<p>“Lord Dashleigh!” exclaimed the countess, “that
was never intended—”</p>

<p>“Never intended for my eye!” thundered the
earl, who was in a violent passion; and tearing the
manuscript into a hundred pieces, he trampled it
under his foot!</p>

<p>“That is the action of a pettish child!” exclaimed
Annabella, almost as much irritated as her husband,
her eyes flashing indignant fire.</p>

<p>“Leave the room, insolent girl!” cried the earl;
and turning round as he spoke, he perceived to his
surprise and inexpressible annoyance that he had two
unexpected auditors—his servant having a moment
before opened the door, to announce the Duke of
Montleroy, who was following close behind!</p>

<p>Dashleigh was so much confused—overwhelmed
at being discovered by such a person in such a position—that
of a husband quarrelling with his own
wife, and giving way to a burst of passion degrading
to any man, but most of all to one of his exalted
station—that he remained for some minutes transfixed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
totally unable to speak. Annabella, on the contrary,
lost none of her self-possession. She swept
past the bewildered duke, with a passing reverence
which might have beseemed an empress, and proceeded
at once to her own chamber, without uttering
a word. As soon as she had reached it, she violently
rang her bell.</p>

<p>The maid who obeyed the summons found her
mistress sitting at her toilette table, calm, tearless,
but pale with suppressed emotion. She was selecting
various articles of jewellery from a large mahogany
box.</p>

<p>“Bates, bid the coachman put the horses to
directly, and do you prepare to accompany me in
the carriage,” was the countess’s brief command.</p>

<p>The lady had, not an hour before, returned from
a lengthened drive, and the order surprised the maid.
She ventured to say something about the late hour
and the appearance of coming rain.</p>

<p>“Let it rain torrents—what matters it?” cried
Annabella. “Bear my message to Mullins, and return
without delay to pack up the things which I
shall require. I shall sleep at the vicarage to-night.”</p>

<p>The lady’s-maid hurried away to the servant’s
hall, which she found in a state of considerable excitement,
for the news had already spread like wild-fire
through the house that my lord had quarrelled
with my lady, torn up her writings, ordered her out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
of the room—nay, as it was rumoured, had actually
struck her on the face.</p>

<p>“Take my word for it,” cried the butler, with the
air of one who can see much further through a millstone
than others,—“take my word for it this has
something to do with the odd couple as came here
the other day,—the fine lady, and the fierce old man
with black brows and long white hair.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied another servant, with a nod, “I’ve
noticed that nothing has gone right up stairs since
them two drove off in the donkey-chaise, and my
lady shut herself up in her room, as if she’d had a
down-right set-down from my lord.”</p>

<p>“Oh, for the matter of that,” laughed Bates, “she’d
give as good as she gets, any day. The earl has
ordered her out of the room; but she’s going a little
further than may be he wished or expected. She
has a spirit of her own, has my lady!”</p>

<p>In the meantime, Annabella was pacing up and
down her apartment with a heart full almost to
bursting. “I will not stay here, no, not an hour!”
she exclaimed; “he shall find that he has no weak
girl to deal with—no slave to submit to his pride
and caprice! I have borne much, but this I will
not bear. I will not endure to be trampled upon
by a tyrant, even though that tyrant be a husband.
I will go to the vicarage at once. Mr. Aumerle will
not forget that my mother was the sister of the wife
whom he loved. He will not deny the shelter of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
his roof to an orphan, so cruelly driven from her
own. I will impose no burden upon my friends. I
ask, I need nothing from any one but the sympathy
which my griefs, and the justice which my wrongs
demand.”</p>

<p>Thus, asking counsel only of her own angry passions,
casting aside all higher considerations, and
seeking but the gratification of her bitter pride and
resentment, the young Countess of Dashleigh prepared
to take a step which scarcely any circumstances
could justify. Intoxicated as she was with
anger, the voice of reason and of conscience were
alike unheard or unheeded. Indignant at the errors
of her husband, Annabella was blinded to her own;
and when she found her domestic happiness wrecked,
her youthful hopes scattered like leaves in a storm,
she recognised not the cause of the evil—she traced
not in the desolation around her the work of the
demon Pride.</p>

</div>

<p>On that evening, a small but cheerful party were
assembled in the sitting-room of the vicarage. Dr. Bardon
and his daughter Cecilia, oft-invited guests, had
joined the circle of the Aumerles. A week never passed
without some little act of kindness being shown by
the clergyman or his family to the disinherited man.
Bardon heartily esteemed, and even felt a warm regard
for the vicar. But let it not be supposed that
he was overburdened with a sense of gratitude for
unwearying kindness and attention. No, he was far
too proud for that. The doctor was ever keeping a
balance in his mind between benefits received and
benefits conferred; and by means of that curious
mental instrument, of which Mabel had penetrated
the secret, he managed always, in his own opinion,
to keep the balance weighed down in his favour. If
the Aumerles showed him hospitality, it was, he
easily persuaded himself, because they were really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
glad to have a little society. Bardon did them an
actual favour by so often eating their dinners!
Volunteered advice upon diet and medical subjects,
though given to those whose health was perfect, the
doctor also regarded as obligations of no trivial nature;
and he often calculated how much the Aumerles
owed to him in the shape of fees!</p>

<p>On this evening the mind of Bardon was particularly
easy, for he had brought to the vicar the gift
of a crystallized pebble, which he had discovered in
some ancient drawer, and which, he was perfectly
assured, must be a curious geological specimen. The
Aumerles had sufficient of that politeness which is
“good-nature refined,” to humour the fancy of their
guest; and there was a discussion for nearly twenty
minutes upon the beauties, peculiarities, and supposed
origin of the wonderful stone.</p>

<p>A heavy rain is pattering without, and flashes of
bright lightning are occasionally reflected on the
wall; but safe in the comfortable dwelling, the party
give little heed to the weather. In one corner sits
Dr. Bardon, engaged in a game of chess with Mrs.
Aumerle. He considers that he is giving her a lesson;
she, having no particular desire to learn the game,
and finding no great amusement in an inevitable
check-mate, is good-humouredly submitting to be
beaten for the gratification of her guest. Cecilia,
rather over-dressed, as usual, as if, as Mabel once
observed, she were always expecting a grand party,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
after much persuasion, which she regards as the indispensable
prelude to her performance, has passed
her pink ribbon over her neck, and is giving her
friends a song, to the accompaniment of the guitar.
It is with her music as with things more important,
Cecilia, in her efforts to rise above mediocrity, only
manages to sink below it. She is not contented with
the soft middle tones, in which her voice shows considerable
sweetness; Cecilia must sing very high;
and the painful result is, that the strained organ cannot
reach the prescribed point, falls flat, and discord
annoys the ear. Miss Bardon is not satisfied with
simple ballads, which she could sing with feeling and
taste; she must show off her very indifferent execution
in difficult bravura airs. As her dress must be
that of a peeress, so her music must be that of a professor.
Cecilia aims not at giving pleasure, but at
exciting admiration, and succeeds in accomplishing
neither object. Poor Ida, a distressed listener to the
flourishes in “Bel raggio lusinghier,” is meditating
how she can contrive to unite politeness with truthfulness;
and in thanking Miss Bardon for her song,
neither violate sincerity nor hurt the feelings of her
sensitive friend. Mabel, who has kept up a low,
whispered conversation with her uncle at the very
farthest end of the room, is impatiently waiting till
Cecilia’s cadenzas and appoggiaturas shall cease, to
speak to her father on a subject of which her mind
is quite full.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>The last twang at length is given; Ida says, what
she can say; if it be a little less than the singer
would have liked, it is a little more than the speaker’s
conscience could warrant. Mr. Aumerle’s simple
thanks have been uttered, and Mabel, released from
the necessity of being comparatively quiet, runs up to
her father, and says, playfully leaning on his arm; “O
papa! I have such a favour, such a great favour to ask
of you!”</p>

<p>“If it be anything reasonable.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know if you’ll think it reasonable or not,
but Uncle Augustine sees no objections. He says that
he will, if you only consent, take me up with him
in the balloon!”</p>

<p>“My child!” exclaimed the vicar.</p>

<p>“Bless the girl!” cried Mrs. Aumerle from her
chess-board. Cecilia lifted her hands in surprise,
while Dr. Bardon laughed aloud.</p>

<p>“O papa! what’s the harm? It is not as
if a party of strangers were going on the airy
excursion,—people who did not know how to
manage. Mr. Verdon is so experienced, he has
been up fourteen or fifteen times, and no accident
ever has happened. Uncle Augustine goes
himself!”</p>

<p>“But because Uncle Augustine chooses to risk his
own neck sky-larking amongst the clouds, I see no
reason why he should carry my little girl with him
on a dangerous excursion.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>“Shakspeare tells us,” said Augustine, coming
towards the centre of the room, “that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘’Tis dangerous to take a cold, to sleep, to drink,’</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>but the poet adds</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘Out of the nettle, danger, we pluck the flower, safety.’</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When steam-vessels were first introduced it was
thought an act of daring to go in one,—when railroads
were yet a novelty it was foolhardiness to venture
in a train.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” joined in the eager Mabel, “balloons
will some day become as common as carriages!”</p>

<p>“In that case,” observed the doctor, “perhaps Miss
Mabel will not care to enter one.”</p>

<p>Mabel coloured and laughed. “I daresay,” she
replied, “that there is something in the excitement
and danger,—<em>supposed</em> danger I mean,—that makes
the thought of such a trip so delightful. I should
like, I own, to do something which no lady in the
county ever has done before.”</p>

<p>“That’s pride,” said her step-mother abruptly.</p>

<p>Such a gush of fierce angry emotion rose in the
heart of the young girl at the word, opprobrious and
yet so true, that Augustine, perceiving her feelings in
her face, and fearing that she might give them vent,
thought it as well to effect an immediate diversion.
“I hope,” said he, turning towards the doctor, “that
you and Miss Bardon will honour Aspendale by your
presence on the day of the ascent of the <i>Eaglet</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>The doctor bowed, for his <em>sensitiveness</em> was gratified
by the respectful terms in which the invitation
was couched.</p>

<p>“We shall not be a large, but a select party,” continued
Augustine Aumerle. “I met Reginald Dashleigh
to-day, and I think that he and his lady will
come to witness the ascent.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say that you expect the earl as
one of your guests?” exclaimed Bardon.</p>

<p>“If nothing prevent, I think that you will meet
him at my house.”</p>

<p>“Something will prevent!” cried the old lion,
shaking his white mane with haughty disdain. “I
am willing to meet at your table any one else whom
you may choose to invite;—I would sit down with
farmer—ploughboy—pauper, but not—not with
Reginald Earl of Dashleigh!”</p>

<p>An uncomfortable silence instantly fell like cold
water over the circle; the vicar, a peacemaker by
nature as well as profession, was particularly annoyed
by this unexpected declaration of enmity against his
niece’s husband, made by one of his own oldest friends.
He was in act to speak, when Mabel suddenly exclaimed,
“There is the sound of a carriage!”</p>

<p>“You must be mistaken,” said Mrs. Aumerle, “no
one would come at this hour, and especially on so
stormy an evening.”</p>

<p>“But it is a carriage,” said Mabel, going to the
window, “I see the red liveries of the Dashleighs.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>The sentence unconsciously escaped her lip, and
she bit it with vexation at having thoughtlessly
uttered the name; for the doctor started up from his
seat so hastily, that he upset the chess-table before
him.</p>

<p>This created a little noise and confusion, in the
midst of which Annabella suddenly entered the room
unannounced, looking so haggard and ill, that her
uncle involuntary exclaimed, “My dear Anna! has
anything happened?”</p>

<p>“Might I speak with you for a moment alone,”
said the countess assuming with effort a forced calmness.
The vicar, without reply, took her by the
trembling hand, and led her to his own little study.</p>

<p>“Dear me! how ill the countess looks!” exclaimed
Cecilia.</p>

<p>“Something serious has occurred, depend upon it,”
said Mrs. Aumerle; and a variety of conjectures arose
as to the cause of the lady’s strange visit, though
most of the party present had the prudence to keep
these conjectures to themselves.</p>

<p>The vicar returned after rather a long absence, and
his entrance caused a dead silence in the room, while
every eye rested on him with a look of inquiry.
He appeared very grave, and drawing his wife aside,
said in a low tone of voice, “My dear, do you think
that Ida could arrange to share Mabel’s apartment
to-night, and give up her own to Annabella?”</p>

<p>“Is the countess so unwell that she cannot return<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
to her own home? The weather seems to be clearing,”
said the vicar’s wife in a voice much more
audible than that of her husband had been.</p>

<p>“She does not wish to return,” replied Mr. Aumerle
sadly; “we must all do our best to make her comfortable
here, at least for the present.”</p>

<p>In a few minutes Ida had glided out of the room,
and was in the study at the side of her cousin, listening
with wonder and pain to the passionate outpourings
of a wounded spirit. Cecilia who delighted in
anything mysterious, was endeavouring to draw from
Mabel her opinion as to the cause of the countess’s
distress, and Mrs. Aumerle was bustling about to
“make things smooth,” as she said, in the household
department, of which the arrangements had been so
suddenly disturbed by the unexpected arrival.</p>

<p>“Something wrong with Dashleigh, I fear,” observed
Augustine half aloud.</p>

<p>“Something wrong—everything wrong, I should
say!” exclaimed the doctor who overheard him.
“The case is clear enough to any one who has had
a glimpse behind the scenes as I have had. The
poor little thing is wretched at home, she has sold
her happiness for a title, she has thrown herself away
on the most proud, selfish, domineering—”</p>

<p>“Dashleigh is my friend,” interrupted Augustine
sternly.</p>

<p>“I’d rather have him for my enemy than my friend!”
muttered Bardon between his clenched teeth.</p>

<p>“Don’t talk to me,” cried Mrs. Aumerle, in the tone
of decision which to her was habitual; “I say that
a young wife does wrong, exceedingly wrong, in leaving
the home of her natural protector, and throwing
herself back upon her own family, just because she and
her husband have chanced to have some unpleasant
words together.”</p>

<p>The time was the afternoon of the day following
that of Annabella’s unexpected arrival; the scene was
the sitting-room at the vicarage; the auditor, Mabel
Aumerle.</p>

<p>“Unpleasant words!” repeated Mabel angrily;
“why the earl tore her writing to pieces, and ordered
her out of the room, before her own servant—only
think of that, before her own liveried servant! No
woman of spirit could submit to that!”</p>

<p>“Woman of spirit—nonsense!” cried the step-mother,
“a woman’s spirit ought to be one of submission.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>“I would have done what she did!” said Mabel.</p>

<p>“I daresay that you would,” answered Mrs.
Aumerle, with a touch of sarcasm in her manner;
“but I happen to know a good deal more of life than
you do, and mind my word, Mabel, when a woman
marries she takes her husband for better for worse;
she has made her choice and she must abide by it;
she only lowers herself by appealing to the world to
arbitrate between her and the man whom she has
vowed to obey.”</p>

<p>“How has Annabella appealed to the world?”
asked Mabel, with but little of respect in her tone.</p>

<p>“By making herself the talk of the world.
There’s not a house in Pelton, no, nor much farther
round, in which the flight of the countess and
its cause is not the subject of conversation. The
gossips are feasting on the news, and doubtless by
to-morrow morning we shall have the whole affair,
with every kind of exaggeration, appearing in the
county paper. I’ve really no patience with the
girl! And to mix us up with her folly! I feel as
if I were aiding and abetting a wife’s rebellion
against her husband.”</p>

<p>“Unfeeling creature!” thought Mabel, whose partiality
for her cousin, and high-flown spirit of romance,
made her espouse the countess’s cause with
the chivalric devotion of a knight errant towards
some fair and persecuted damsel.</p>

<p>“I am sure I hope that she does not intend to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
prolong her stay here,” continued Mrs. Aumerle.
“To say nothing, of the inconvenience of accommodating
herself and her fine maid, I think it an evil to
have in the house one who sets such an example of
wilfulness and pride.”</p>

<p>“Papa could never but welcome to his home the
orphan niece of my own beloved mother,” exclaimed
Mabel, with flashing eyes, feeling as though she were
doing a lofty and generous action in defending the
cause of the oppressed.</p>

<p>“A child of fifteen is no judge of these matters,
and would show her good sense best by her silence,”
was the cold observation of Mrs. Aumerle.</p>

<p>Mabel’s proud spirit was thoroughly roused by
this remark. Her present mood seemed strangely
inconsistent with the softened humility which she
had shown, when in the arbour a few days previously,
she had leant her head on her sister’s bosom, feeling
herself indeed to be a poor, helpless sinner!
But is not this a species of inconsistency which, by
experience, we know to be but too common in the
heart? We prostrate ourselves before God, but
stand erect before our fellow-creatures: we own our
infirmities in the quiet hour when religion speaks to
the soul, but start back with angry indignation,
if those weaknesses be touched upon by another.
Pride stands back when we, in solitude, or with one
chosen friend, review our past conduct and mourn
over our faults, but springs forward if a rebuke,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
however just, be not sweetened by flattery, or tempered
by caution.</p>

<p>Mabel disliked her stepmother, and did not care
to hide that dislike from its object. The feeling
partly arose from a want of tenderness and tact on
the part of Mrs. Aumerle. That lady, with much
common sense, high principle, and warmth of heart,
was quite devoid of that nice apprehension of tender
points, that delicacy in touching upon painful subjects,
which is morally, what <em>feelers</em> are physically to some
of the insect creation. Mrs. Aumerle had no <em>feelers</em>,
and she rather prided herself on the want. She
classed nerves, sensibility, timidity, romance, under
the one comprehensive title of “humbug;” things
which, like cobwebs, she would have thought too insignificant
to be noticed, had they not been, to the
mental eye, too unsightly to be spared. Mrs.
Aumerle’s sympathies were quick and active in cases
of what she regarded as real distress. She was an
eminently practical woman, and did much good in
her husband’s parish; but she had no pity for nervous
complaints, no patience for fanciful troubles.
It may be imagined how little of congeniality there
could be between such a character and that of the
refined sensitive Ida, the romantic impulsive Mabel.</p>

<p>But without congeniality there should have been,
on the part of the stepdaughters, a just appreciation
of merit, meek submission to authority, and due
respect of manner. If Mabel, on all these points,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
was by far the most open offender, Ida, on her part,
was assuredly not free from her share of blame.
Her youngest sister looked up to her both as a guide
and example. Mabel’s highest ambition was to copy
the character of Ida, and like most young artists, she
unintentionally exaggerated all the defects of what
she copied. Mabel seemed to have an intuitive perception
of the fact that Ida held her stepmother in
low estimation, regarded her advice as valueless,
took her reproofs almost as wrongs. Ida, unwittingly,
was nurturing in her sister a spirit of proud independence,
much more congenial, alas! to the human
heart, than the faith, humility, and love which the
young Christian earnestly sought to implant in her
young companion. Ida was to a certain degree
counteracting the effects of her own counsels, defeating
the aim of her own prayers.</p>

<p>Mabel, on the present occasion, was so much irritated
by her stepmother’s recommendation of silence,
that she was about to utter an insolent reply, when
the conversation was fortunately interrupted by the
entrance of her father, whose presence ever acted as
a check on any ebullition of temper.</p>

<p>“Well, Lawrence,” said Mrs. Aumerle, coming forward
to meet her husband, “I hope that this unpleasant
affair is to come to a speedy end.”</p>

<p>“God grant it!” replied the clergyman. “Have
you spoken to Annabella?”</p>

<p>“I was beginning to tell her a little of my mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
when she implored me to leave the room. She has
rather too much of the countess about her, to care to
listen to simple truth. She was in a highly excited
state; I should not wonder if she were in a fever
to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Do you think that we should send for Dr.
Bardon?”</p>

<p>“He’ll come, sure enough, without our sending.
We shall have no peace as long as the countess remains
here. All the idle, curious people in the
county will find some excuse for visiting the vicarage.
The Greys, Whitemans, and Barclays have
been here to-day already. I have given Mary orders
to let in nobody but the Doctor.”</p>

<p>“Is Ida with her cousin?” asked Aumerle.</p>

<p>“She has hardly been out of her room from the
first.”</p>

<p>“That is well,” said the vicar; “my child will
do her best to calm and to soften.”</p>

<p>“I think that it is the earl who must require to
be calmed and softened,” observed Mrs. Aumerle;
“he has been very shamefully treated.”</p>

<p>“Augustine has, as you are aware, undertaken a
mission to him. I would have gone myself, but my
brother’s greater intimacy with Dashleigh, and superior
powers of persuasion, would, I felt, make him
a more effectual advocate for this poor misguided
young creature. I thought that he would have been
back ere now. I await his return with great anxiety.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>“Here comes my uncle!” exclaimed Mabel.</p>

<p>Aumerle met his brother at the door. “Any
good tidings?” he exclaimed. Augustine shook his
head doubtingly as they entered the sitting-room
together.</p>

<p>“The earl is extremely indignant,” he said, removing
the hat from his heated brow; “I have been
arguing with him for more than an hour, and I
have my doubts as to whether we have come to a
satisfactory conclusion at last.”</p>

<p>“Oh, on what does he decide?” cried Mabel.</p>

<p>“He consents at length to pardon the countess’s
act of foolish petulance, on condition that she ask his
forgiveness, and return this very day to her home.”</p>

<p>“Reasonable terms!” said Mrs. Aumerle.</p>

<p>“Yes,” assented the vicar, but the little furrow of
anxious thought still remained on his brow. “Augustine,”
he said to his brother, “will you go and communicate
your message to Annabella?”</p>

<p>“Nay, nay, I have done my part. If I have more
influence with my old college-companion, you have
more power with your niece. I suspect that your
task will be at least as difficult as mine, notwithstanding
your gentle auxiliaries. I have so little expectation
of your success, that I have ordered a conveyance
to take me to Aspendale an hour hence, that
I may leave your dwelling more free to accommodate
its new guest.”</p>

<p>“I hope,” said Mrs. Aumerle, “that the conveyance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
will rather be required to take Annabella
back to the home which she should never have
quitted.”</p>

<p>“I hope so too,” observed Augustine with a smile;
“but I own that I have my doubts and my fears on
the matter.”</p>

<p>The vicar at once proceeded to the room in which
Ida was endeavouring, though with little effect, to
soothe the irritated spirit of her cousin. Annabella
rose on the clergyman’s entrance, and Ida, from
a feeling of delicacy, silently left the apartment.</p>

<p>Aumerle gently communicated to his impatient
auditor the message which he bore.</p>

<p>“His pardon!” exclaimed Annabella, striking
her little hand with vehemence on a table which was
beside her; “his pardon, forsooth! and for what?
Nay, then, I see the truth of the words—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘Forgiveness to the injured doth belong,</div>
<div class="verse">He never pardons who hath done the wrong,’”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>and she laughed in the bitterness of her soul.</p>

<p>“My dear niece,” said the vicar tenderly but
gravely, “even by your own account you had given
just cause of displeasure to your husband, before he
spoke the hasty word which you find it so difficult to
forgive. Prejudice may blind you—”</p>

<p>“Uncle, let me have no more of this; I can’t bear
it!” exclaimed Annabella, rising in nervous excitement.
“If I am in your way—in Mrs. Aumerle’s
way, I will leave the house at once, go to London—an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
hotel—anywhere—but I will not—” Her
voice rose, and again she struck the table as she repeated
the words,—“I will not go and beg pardon
of the man who turned me out of my own room, and
in the presence of a menial servant.”</p>

<p>“Annabella, this is the excitement of fever; you
require—surely I hear Bardon’s voice below!” said
the vicar, who found it impossible to manage his niece
in her present mood, and who was almost alarmed at
the wildness of her manner. “Would you see the
doctor?” added Mr. Aumerle.</p>

<p>Annabella hesitated for a moment, then exclaimed,
“Dr. Bardon! yes, I will see him at once.” She remained
in her standing position, rigid as a statue, till
the vicar, after a brief absence, introduced the physician
into the room, and then himself retired to
another.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The countess advanced one step towards Bardon,
and held out her hand. He took it cordially, and
looked at her bloodless face with mingled interest and
concern.</p>

<p>“Do not suppose,” said Annabella, resuming her
seat, and motioning to him to take a chair beside her,—“do
not suppose that I see you in order to ask for
your medical advice. You must know well that it
is beyond your power to ‘minister to a mind diseased,’
that my case is not one which the whole
pharmacopeia can cure. I see you as a friend,”—her
lip quivered as she spoke,—“as one who will
understand my feelings, and not torment me with
well-meant advice which I would rather die than
follow!”</p>

<p>“You are a noble creature—a brave creature!”
exclaimed Bardon; “I am proud of the spirit which
you have shown.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>“Have you been far to-day?” asked the countess,
colouring slightly at the ill-merited praise.</p>

<p>“I was at Pelton this morning on business, or I
should have called upon you earlier,” was the doctor’s
reply.</p>

<p>“You have been, doubtless, at many houses,”—Annabella
seemed to frame each sentence with
difficulty,—“you have seen many people—have
heard—heard much that is—that must be said—and—.”
She stopped, and looked at the doctor, but
he did not seem disposed to guess the meaning of
her unfinished sentence.</p>

<p>“I wish to learn from you,” continued the
countess, forcing herself to a more explicit explanation;
“it is important for me to know what the
world says of this—this unhappy affair.”</p>

<p>“You care as little as I do for what the world
says,” replied the doctor.</p>

<p>But it was not so with Annabella. Popular distinction,
the applause of others, had been to her as
the breath of life. Her pride was not the pride of
self-sufficiency; she was intensely desirous to know
whether public opinion were inclining to her side or
that of her lord, and she pressed the doctor for a
more definite reply.</p>

<p>“Of course,” he answered at last, “there are almost
as many versions of the story as there are narrators
of it. No tale loses by the telling. Some say
this thing, some say that, some pity, and some blame.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
What is, however, pretty universally received as the
most authentic account is—”</p>

<p>“Tell me!” cried the countess nervously, as the
speaker paused.</p>

<p>“Why, it is said that you had somehow got into
the snares of the Papists. That an old priest and a
nun in disguise had made their way into Dashleigh
Hall; and, some affirm, had a private mass there.
That the earl discovered amongst your papers a
prayer to the Virgin, or something of that sort, and
that he was so much disgusted by what he called your
apostasy, that tearing the paper into a thousand
fragments, he turned you out of the room.”</p>

<p>“Did any one believe such a senseless tale?” cried
Annabella.</p>

<p>“It was said to come from the best authority, and
is very generally credited.”</p>

<p>“Did you not give it indignant refutation?”</p>

<p>“My dear lady, you forget that I am in utter
darkness upon the subject myself. I could stake my
life that you had good cause for what you did, but of
that cause I know no more than this chair.”</p>

<p>“Then you shall know all,” exclaimed Annabella,
“that you may be able to give an answer to such idle
calumnies as these;” and with rapid utterance she
gave the doctor an account of what had occurred, her
narrative following truth in the main, though
coloured by prejudice and passion.</p>

<p>Bardon’s face showed gloomy satisfaction as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
listened to the excited speaker. “So then,” he exclaimed
as she concluded, “your crime is having
drawn so faithful a portrait, that he who sat for it
would not own it! What a fool he was to quarrel
with one who has him so completely at her mercy!”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” said Annabella quickly.</p>

<p>“You carried your desk with you, did you not?”
said Bardon, with an expressive glance at that on the
table; “and you carried with you the wit that can
sting. Write out that paper again; give it to the
public;—the world will laugh, and the earl will
wince. No one who reads but will understand (I
will do my best to enlighten dull comprehensions)
<em>why</em> the peer was so angry with his wife—<em>why</em> he
who stood trembling on the mountain was afraid of
the wit of a woman.”</p>

<p>“It would be retribution!” exclaimed Annabella.</p>

<p>“It would be revenge!” cried the haughty old
man.</p>

<p>Little did the Aumerles divine that the physician
whom they had admitted in order that he might
quiet a fevered pulse, was pouring venom into a
wound which he should rather have sought to heal;
that he was doing the work, obeying the hest of the
demon Pride, and drawing further from happiness and
peace the young creature who had turned to him in
her distress.</p>

<p>There was a strange, almost fierce satisfaction in
the looks of Dr. Bardon when he descended to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
sitting-room, that was incomprehensible to the Aumerles.</p>

<p>“You will send her a sleeping draught?” said the
vicar.</p>

<p>“I have given her something <em>to compose</em>,” replied
Bardon, a grim smile relaxing his features.</p>

<p>“You think her very feverish?” inquired Ida.</p>

<p>“Oh, there’s nothing to alarm,” said the doctor;
“she will be much relieved by-and-bye.”</p>

<p>As soon as he had quitted the vicarage, Ida went up
to Annabella’s room, and gently knocked at the door.</p>

<p>“I wish to be alone!” said a voice from within,
and Ida immediately retired.</p>

<p>When the carriage which had been ordered by
Augustine Aumerle rolled up to the front of the
vicarage, Ida was sent again to try her powers of
persuasion, to induce the countess to avail herself of
it to return to her husband’s home.</p>

<p>Ida felt the errand painful, and almost hopeless.
She hesitated for a moment ere she knocked, and
heard within the sound of a pen moving rapidly over
the paper.</p>

<p>“Annabella, my love,” began Ida, as she softly unclosed
the door.</p>

<p>The countess was bending over her desk, apparently
absorbed in writing. Her back was towards
the door, but she started on the entrance of Ida, and
turning hastily round showed a countenance crimsoned
to the temples with a burning flush.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>“I can’t be disturbed!” she exclaimed in a voice
strangely harsh and impatient.</p>

<p>“O dear cousin!” cried Ida, “if you would but
listen for a moment—”</p>

<p>“I will hear you to-morrow,” said Annabella, “let
me feel that in this room at least I am safe from unwelcome
intrusion!”</p>

<p>Intrusion! what a word—and from those
lips! Ida Aumerle was deeply hurt, not to say
offended, and returned again to her family mortified
and dejected. The vicar breathed a weary sigh, and
Mrs. Aumerle said something about “a termagant,”
which made Mabel extremely angry.</p>

<p>“So then I must be off!” said Augustine. “I
had so little hope of the fair lady’s yielding, that,
as you see, my travelling bag is all ready. Farewell,
Mrs. Aumerle; thanks for your hospitality. Lawrence,
remember that I expect you all at Aspendale
on the 12th. I shall be glad if by that time you
think my friend Mabel sufficiently fledged to try a
flight in the blue empyrean!”</p>

<p>After her uncle’s departure Ida retired with a
heavy heart to the little room which, since Annabella’s
arrival, she had shared with her sister Mabel.
The gratitude which a woman feels towards one who
has offered to her his home and his heart, and the affection
which Ida had from childhood entertained for
her cousin, rendered both the earl and the countess
objects of deep interest to the maiden. Family division<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
jarred on her soul, like discord on a musical ear,
and Ida felt perhaps as forcibly as her stepmother
could, the evil of the course which Annabella was
wilfully pursuing. She was wounded by the words
of impatience from her cousin, which sensitiveness
construed into actual unkindness, and Ida could
scarcely draw her thoughts sufficiently from the subject
which engrossed them, to write a letter in reply
to some petition for relief which she knew that it
would be wrong to postpone.</p>

<p>Ida lingered over her letter till she began to fear
that it might be late for the post, to which she proposed
taking it herself. As she was putting on her
scarf, in preparation for her walk, Ida heard the
countess’s bell,—Annabella was ringing for her
maid. When Ida left her apartment she met the
attendant in the passage, on her return from the
room of the lady.</p>

<p>“Is the countess feeling unwell?” inquired Ida.</p>

<p>“Her ladyship only rang,” replied Bates, “to
desire me to get ready to carry her letters to the
post.”</p>

<p>“I am going thither myself,” said Ida; “I will take
my cousin’s notes; I think that you might be late.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, miss,” replied the maid; “but my
lady said expressly that I was to post the letters myself,
and not let them out of my hand till I did so.
Perhaps I might carry yours also, Miss Aumerle; I
shall not be a minute in dressing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>Ida thanked the maid for the offer, and gave the
note into her charge. But when Bates had hurried
off to make her little preparations, Ida stood motionless
in thought. Her heart misgave her as to the
nature of the despatches which Annabella had evidently
written with such nervous haste, and was
about to send off with such anxious precaution.
Why should the countess object to trust her letters
to any one but her own menial servant? did she
fear that the eye of a loving relative should chance
to rest on the address? Was Annabella about to
take some foolish step which should further alienate
her from her husband? Ida remembered with pain
the expression which she had last beheld on the
countess’s face.</p>

<p>“I had better go to her,—I may be in time to
prevent some act which Annabella would hereafter
bitterly regret.” This was Ida’s first thought, and
under its impulse she almost laid her finger on the
handle of her cousin’s door. But another feeling
made her pause and draw back. Had she not already
found her presence regarded as an unwelcome
intrusion,—should she subject herself again to repulse?
“Back! back!” whispered Pride, though so
softly that his tones were not recognised; “force not
your society on one who does not desire it, your counsel
on her who despises it.”</p>

<p>Ida hesitated—went away some few steps, and
then returned to the door, as if attracted towards her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
unhappy cousin by some invisible spell. Again
there was a moment’s reflection, again Pride recalled
to her mind her late discourteous reception by the
countess, and with a sigh of doubt and apprehension,
Ida Aumerle returned to her own room.</p>

<p>In the meantime Annabella with a trembling hand
had sealed up two large envelopes. The one contained
“The Precipice and the Peer,” hastily but
vigorously written, and was directed to the editor
of the magazine in which the countess had, as before
mentioned, occasionally written. The other letter
was addressed to her publisher in London, giving
him her free permission not only to complete the
printing of her romance, but to put the authoress’s
name on the title-page, not as “Egeria,” but “the
Countess of Dashleigh.”</p>

<p>“I will show my lord,” thought the proud, young
authoress, “that I can bring more dignity to the
name by my pen, than he by his sounding title. I
shall make him envy the renown of the woman whom
he thought it condescension to marry! He has thought
to humble—to subdue—to crush me; I will prove
to him that I can stand alone, ay, stand on a loftier
pedestal than any to which he ever had power to
raise me! And <em>he</em> will be humbled, mortified! He
would not have the world even guess that his wife
could join the throng of authors, or touch a publisher’s
pay; he will see that his wife glories in the
talents which admit her among the aristocracy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
genius! I have now broken my chain, and can soar
aloft unfettered!”</p>

<p>Thoughts like these animated the ambitious girl
while actually engaged in her work. Intoxicated by
anger and pride, she gave no audience to reason or
conscience, but wrote as if writing for life. But when
Annabella had actually placed the two letters in the
hands of her maid, when she had heard the door
close after Bates, there came a sudden revulsion of
feeling, and the countess was startled and alarmed at
what she herself had done. Was she not giving
mortal offence to him whom she was bound to honour?
could she expose him to ridicule without bringing
deeper disgrace upon herself? Had not the
church pronounced them to be one? Annabella’s
eye fell on the little circlet of gold which Reginald
had placed on her finger on the solemn occasion when,
in the sight of men, and the presence of God, she
had taken him for her wedded husband, never to be
divided from him, as she then hoped and believed,
until death itself should them part! How many
associations were linked with the sight of that ring!
If gratified pride had powerfully inclined Annabella
to incline to Reginald’s suit, that pride had once been
closely linked with love. She had once listened
eagerly for his step, fondly gazed on his handwriting,
heard the tones of his voice with delight, and believed
her heart to be unalterably his! Annabella
ran to her window which commanded a prospect of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
the road which led to the village, with an undefined
yet strong wish to call back the messenger whom
she had sent. She saw Bates walking briskly from
the house, but yet so near, that her mistress’s voice
might reach her. The countess called her, but faintly,
for a feeling of shame choked her voice. Bates did
not hear, did not stop. But the sound reached another
ear, and Mabel, attired for a walk, came forth
from the house, and looked up to the window at
which the countess now stood. The young girl’s
face was bright and kindly, and the light shining on
her blue eyes and auburn tresses, gave her, to the
fancy of her cousin, the appearance of pictured Hope.</p>

<p>“Did you wish to call back Bates?” asked Mabel.
“I will run and being her back in a moment.”</p>

<p>How important in life may be a single second,
when on its little point hangs a momentous decision!
The countess almost pronounced the word “yes!”
but with the rapidity of lightning, Pride poured his
suggestions into her ear. Not only would the revocation
of the order given appear weak indecision to
the maid, but Mabel would naturally carry back the
letters, while Bates proceeded to the post with Ida’s,
and she could hardly avoid seeing their addresses. She
would then easily guess the cause of their writer’s
vacillation and change of purpose; she would conclude
that her cousin had penned that which she was afraid
or ashamed to send. These ideas took much less
time in rushing through the brain of Annabella, than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
they have done in passing before the eye of the
reader, and they silenced the assent which trembled
on the lip of the irresolute countess.</p>

<p>“Shall I call back Bates?” asked Mabel again.</p>

<p>“No,” answered Annabella from above; and retiring
from the window the miserable girl threw herself
on a chair, and exclaiming, “It is too late now,—too
late! the irrevocable step is taken!” she
covered her face with her hands, as if by so doing
she could shut out reflection. Yet, strange to say,
she yet clung to the shadow of a hope that Bates
might find the post-office closed, and bring back to
her the fatal letters!</p>

<p>The Earl of Dashleigh had suffered more acutely
from the departure of his wife, than Annabella or
the world believed. He missed her presence in his
home more painfully than even to himself he would
own. The nobleman was, as I have said, not of a
hard disposition, and by nature was of a sociable
temperament. Pride had indeed drawn around him
an icy barrier which greatly shut him out from
friendly intercourse with his neighbours, but this very
isolation made him the more dependent upon the few
with whom he could stoop to associate. Dashleigh
had scarcely been aware of how much pleasure he
had derived from his wife’s wit and lively conversation,
till he found himself suddenly thrown on his
own resources which were limited, and his own reflections
which were unpleasant. He wandered
listlessly through his long suite of apartments; their
splendid decorations made them but appear to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
owner more empty, desolate, and dull. Yet Dashleigh
dared not quit them for more cheerful scenes,
for he felt, with the instinctive shrinking of a shy,
proud, sensitive man, that his domestic concerns were
now the theme of a thousand tongues and that he
could appear in no place where he would not be an
object of observation and remark. Solitude was
hateful to the peer, but society would have been yet
more distasteful.</p>

<p>And Dashleigh was not satisfied with himself.
The words of Augustine Aumerle, pleading for an
inexperienced girl doing a foolish thing from a sudden
ebullition of temper, often recurred to the mind of
the husband. A thousand times the questions would
force themselves on his mind. “Have I not been
harsh to Annabella? might I not have overlooked a
fault? would not a little indulgence have touched
a warm heart like hers, and have made her destroy
with her own hand what she knew must have given
me offence? Was not the entrance of the duke at
that most unfortunate moment when I myself had
given way to passion, sufficient to irritate beyond all
power of self-control a woman—a wife—and a
peeress!” There was much of candour, much of
generosity in the spirit of Dashleigh, and so strong
did his self-reproach become, that the earl felt
greatly disposed to pass a sponge over the past, and
exchange mutual forgiveness with his wife. But
then the first advance must be on her side; Pride<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
peremptorily insisted on that. If Annabella were
penitent, Reginald would be generous, but never
would he degrade himself by suing for reconciliation,
however fervently he might desire it.</p>

<p>Thus day passed after day, each more intolerable
than the last, Reginald always hoping that the
pride of his young partner might give way, and
yearning for the supplicating letter which might give
him an excuse for forgiving.</p>

<p>One morning, as the Earl of Dashleigh sat at his
solitary breakfast, he listlessly took up the last number
of the —— Magazine, which the footman had, according
to custom, placed beside the plate of his
master. Light reading was that to which the earl
could alone now bend his attention, and his thoughts
often wandered as he glanced carelessly down the
page. He was however instantly attracted by the
name “Dashleigh” in capital letters on the sheet of
advertisements, and read with a surprise which almost
mastered even his indignation,—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Now in the press.</i></p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="larger">THE FAIRY LAKE:</span> A Romance. By the<br />
<span class="smcap">Countess of Dashleigh</span>.</p>

</div>

<p>“This is indeed throwing away the scabbard; this
is indeed making a parade of insolent disregard of
my wishes and commands! I hardly expected this
from Annabella!” Such was the nobleman’s muttered
exclamation, as he pushed back his chair from the
table. But his feelings received a far ruder shock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
when he examined the periodical more closely. He
gazed on “The Precipice and the Peer,” as it seemed
to glare upon him from the close-printed column, as
if he scarcely could believe the evidence of his senses!
Could it be,—yes—the initial and the dash could not
deceive him, could deceive no one who knew him!
Annabella had held him up to the ridicule of the
world, as a poor, nervous, spiritless wretch,—it was
revenge, mean, despicable revenge, a blow aimed at
the most vulnerable point!</p>

<p>The earl did not tear the periodical, and scatter its
fragments on the wind, he knew that it was spreading
at that hour through the halls and even cottages of
the land; that it was lying on the tradesman’s
counter, in the servant’s hall; that schoolboys were
laughing over the peer’s adventure during the intervals
of more active sport! Dashleigh laid down the
magazine quietly, but with something resembling a
groan! Bardon had said that he would wince,—he
did more, he actually writhed under the torture inflicted
by the hand of his wife!</p>

<p>The servants, wondering at the delay of the accustomed
ring, came at length unsummoned, and bore
away the untasted breakfast. Dashleigh felt annoyed
at the jingling sound, but scarcely comprehended its
cause, and only experienced a sense of relief when
the room became silent again. His reflections were
bitter indeed; he was almost too wretched to be
angry. Was he not a disgraced, an insulted man?—did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
not his very rank make him only a more prominent
mark for ridicule? Could he ever show his face
again in circles which he had once deemed honoured
by his presence? The time-darkened portraits of
deceased Earls of Dashleigh seemed to scowl down
from their heavy gilt frames on the first of the
name who had ever been branded with the imputation
of fear!</p>

<p>A servant brought a letter on a salver; the earl
mechanically broke open the seal. It was from the
vicar, Lawrence Aumerle, and had been written in
the first impulse of his indignant surprise on the appearance
of the obnoxious article which he could not
doubt had been written by his niece.</p>

<p>The clergyman, with instinctive delicacy, avoided
all direct reference to the piece so indiscreetly composed
by Annabella; but he expressed the extreme
distress felt by both his family and himself at the
position in which she had placed herself. He entreated
her husband to believe that if he gave the
lady the protection of his home, it was not because
he sanctioned or even palliated her more than imprudent
conduct, but that he feared that harshness might
drive her from a place where unceasing efforts were
made to bring her to a sense of her duty.</p>

<p>“Lawrence Aumerle is a good man,” said the
earl, passing his hand across his brow, and leaning
thoughtfully back in his chair. “Since all connexion
between me and her is broken now for ever—for ever,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
better that the wretched girl should remain under
the protection of her mother’s relations. It were
worse, far worse that her pride and folly should be
pampered by intercourse with the world,—that world
to which she has sacrificed her husband!”</p>

<p>Dashleigh arose and paced slowly the length of
the room, but returned with a more rapid step.
The name of Aumerle had suddenly suggested to
him a course by which he could fling from himself
the opprobrium which attaches to the name of a
coward. He grasped at the new idea with the
energy of a drowning wretch. The world should
have no cause to laugh at the man whose nerves had
failed him on the heights of a mountain; he would
do that which should from henceforth effectually
silence such reproach. Taking up writing materials,
Dashleigh with rapid hand traced the following note
to Augustine:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Aumerle</span>,—You mentioned to me that a balloon is to
ascend from your grounds on the 12th. I should feel greatly
obliged by your reserving a place for me in the car, as it is my particular
wish to make one in the excursion.—Ever yours,</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Dashleigh</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p>The brief note written and despatched to Aspendale,
the nobleman breathed more freely. He could
meet the eye of his fellow-men. Pride rendered
the effort needful; pride roused his spirit to make
it, and Dashleigh would not now pause to consider
how great that effort might be to one of his nervous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
frame. He felt that his honour was at stake. The
earl was somewhat in the position of the knight of
old, whose lady flung her glove into the arena where
a fierce lion and tiger were contending, and before a
circle of noble spectators, bade him bring it back to
her hand. The knight dreaded the laugh of the
audience more than the yells of the furious beasts,
and Dashleigh shrank from the sneer of the world
more than the untried perils of the air. Annabella
had put her husband on his mettle; she had incited
him to wrestle down nature; but it remained to be
seen whether she had cause to triumph in the effect
produced by her satirical pen.</p>

<p>“I own it, dear Ida, I own it! I did wrong, very
wrong. I felt that as soon as the letter had passed
from my hand; I must have been mad when I sent
it. I wrote to the London editor the next day to
endeavour to stop the publication, but the piece was
already in type.”</p>

<p>Such, after a painful conference, was the confession
which conscience wrung from the Countess of
Dashleigh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>Annabella was reclining on the sofa, her hair
disordered, her eyes red with weeping. Ida was
kneeling beside her, and the magazine lay on the
floor.</p>

<p>“O Anna, Anna! why not own all this to your
husband; throw yourself on his mercy, entreat his
forgiveness—”</p>

<p>“It would be of no use!” exclaimed Annabella;
“that paper he never will forgive. I have already
merited his anger; I will not expose myself to his
contempt.”</p>

<p>“We may be objects of contempt when we
wander from the line of duty, but never when we
are struggling back to it again. When we are lost
in a thorny labyrinth, what wiser, what nobler
course can we pursue, than to retrace every step of
the way?”</p>

<p>“I can’t, I can’t,” gasped Annabella; “there is
now a deep gulf between me and my husband!”</p>

<p>“Which is widening every moment; which delay
may render impassable! It is yet spanned by a
slender bridge of hope; but that bridge is trembling,—shaking,—Annabella,
if you hold back now, it
may sink before your eyes, and for ever!”</p>

<p>“What would you have me to do?” said the
countess.</p>

<p>“Write a letter to the earl full of the humblest
submission; tell him with what real grief and contrition—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ida, you do not know me!” cried Annabella,
pushing the loose hair impatiently back from her
temples; “I cannot play the part of a penitent
child, begging pardon for having been naughty; I
cannot cringe beneath the rod, like a slave trembling
before his master!”</p>

<p>“Anna!” exclaimed Ida, fixing on her cousin
the earnest gaze of her expressive eyes, “must the
slender bridge—your last hope—be broken down
beneath the weight of your pride?”</p>

<p>“Pride,” observed the Countess, “has been termed
the weakness of noble natures.”</p>

<p>“Pride,—what is it,” exclaimed Ida, “as mirrored
in the word of God? Is it not of <em>the world</em>,—that
world that <em>passeth away</em>; doth not the Lord resist
<em>the proud</em>, while giving <em>grace unto the humble</em>?
Doth not inspired truth declare that <em>before destruction
the heart of man is haughty, and before honour
is humility</em>? Is not the Saviour’s blessing on <em>the
meek</em>, and on such as are <em>poor in spirit</em>? Why
should I multiply quotations? Your own heart
must tell you, dear Anna, that if one thing more
than another stands between man and his Maker,
and darkens the light of Heaven, it is the baneful
spirit of pride!”</p>

<p>“It is interwoven with my nature,” said the
countess.</p>

<p>“The life-long battle of the Christian is with his
fallen nature, but it is a struggle in which he is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
left alone. Nay, <em>a new heart</em>, a new nature is given
to those who seek it in earnest prayer; a new heart
filled with the Spirit of God, a new nature conformed
to the likeness of Him who was <em>meek and
lowly</em> in spirit. What are the Bible emblems of
those who are the soldiers and saints of the Lord?
The lamb, the dove, the little child! Can such be
fit types of one who struggles against lawful
authority, and recoils from the duty of submission?”</p>

<p>Annabella was a little nettled. “I think,” she
observed, with some sarcasm in her tone, “that my
saintly cousin is not yet herself so perfect in this
virtue of submission, as to entitle her so eloquently
to enforce it on another.”</p>

<p>Ida glanced up in surprise. She had not been
aware that the quick observation of her cousin had
detected in her the lurking enemy of whose presence
she herself was scarcely aware, and against whom
she was hardly on her guard. But she could not
deny the truth of the accusation so suddenly brought
against her, and was too earnest in the cause which
she was advocating to be silenced by a personal
remark.</p>

<p>“Oh! my dear cousin!” she replied, her soft, dark
eyes filling with tears, “let not my errors be a
stumbling-block in the way of those whom I love.
Look not at the miserable transcript, all stained and
blotted with human infirmity, but turn your eyes to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
the blessed Original which is set before us, that we
may copy its sacred features into our hearts and our
lives! What was the spirit of Christ? and hath
not Truth declared that <em>if any man hath not the
Spirit of Christ he is none of His</em>? Was it not a
spirit patient under suffering, meek under insult, a
spirit ever ready to forgive? Did He not love his
enemies, bless them that cursed Him, and do good to
them that persecuted Him? Look on Him, dearest,
look on Him, till in the brightness of His glory sin
appear all the darker and more hateful! There is
no pride in heaven, Annabella; we must throw away
the chain ere we reach that bright place, or we
never can enter therein! It is pride that is now
shutting you out of your earthly home, barring
against you a husband’s heart, changing domestic
peace to misery. Oh, how terrible the thought
that pride has shut out multitudes from an eternal
home, made them aliens from a heavenly Father,
rendered them sharers in the fate of that terrible
being, who lost a seraph’s crown through his pride!
God grant,—God grant that neither you nor I may
ever be reckoned amongst them!”</p>

<p>The voice of Ida trembled with emotion, the large
tears coursed down her cheeks, and her hands were
tight-clasped as if in earnest supplication. It was a
sister imploring a sister in danger to seek safety
while safety might be found, to tear from her heart
the coiling serpent that was lurking there only to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
destroy! Annabella could not be angry; she was
touched by that pleading look; the ice was beginning
to thaw, and yet was too strong readily to give way.
What was she called upon to do? Not only to forgive,
but to entreat for forgiveness, to humble herself
in the dust before him to whom her proud spirit
had never yet learned to bow! The countess felt
that it would be hardly possible so to stoop,—that
even for heaven itself she could scarcely sacrifice
that which it would be hard to part with, even as a
right hand or a right eye! The momentary struggle
was fearful! Wringing her hands, Annabella exclaimed,
“O Ida, you know not how wretched you
make me!”</p>

<p>“And who deserves to be wretched,” said Mrs.
Aumerle, who happened at this time to enter the
room, “if not she who chooses no guide but her
own temper and caprice, who will listen to no advice—not
even that of her uncle and her pastor, and
who publicly insults the husband whom she is bound
in duty to honour? Rise, Ida, rise,” continued the
lady, to whose plain sense of right and wrong Annabella’s
conduct appeared unpardonable; “I am
ashamed to see you on your knees beside a girl who,
if she were fifty times a countess, has forfeited claim
to our respect.”</p>

<p>Annabella sprang from her sofa, and with eyes
wide open and lips apart, stood listening, as her
hostess, to Ida’s distress and dismay, finished her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
rebuke to one whom she regarded as a spoiled, self-willed,
obstinate child.</p>

<p>“There is only one excuse for you, Anna, and
that is to be found in the indulgence and flattery to
which you have been accustomed from the cradle.
You have been unfitted to take your proper place
either as a wife or the mistress of a household.
You have made everything subservient to your
humour. But it is time to have done with such
childish follies; it is time to renounce the petulant
pride which makes your family blush for you! Mr.
Aumerle is so indulgent, so unwilling to treat any
one harshly, that you are hardly aware, I suspect,
how strongly he feels on the subject; but I can assure
you that he views your late step in the same light
as I do, and he has written to the earl to express to
him his strong disapprobation of your conduct.”</p>

<p>“Has he!” exclaimed the countess almost fiercely,
“then this house is no longer a place for me! I
have stayed here too long already!” and stretching
out her hand to the bell-rope, she pulled it violently
to summon her maid. “I have been driven out of
one home by unkindness, I will not remain in
another to be insulted by such language as you have
dared to address to me!” Again, with the force of
passion, Annabella rang the bell, and it was answered,
not only by Bates but by Mabel, who ran in alarmed
by the second loud ring, and the sound of a voice
raised in anger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>“Bates,” cried the countess, “bring me what I
may require for walking, and then pack up my
boxes, and follow me as soon as possible to the
cottage in which Dr. Bardon resides.”</p>

<p>“But—my lady—”</p>

<p>“At once!” cried the impatient countess.</p>

<p>“O Annabella, dearest Annabella, do not leave
us!” exclaimed Mabel, clinging to her cousin, while
Ida, almost too much agitated to be intelligible,
joined her entreaties to those of her sister.</p>

<p>“Wait—if it were only one day—one hour—only
till papa should return!”</p>

<p>But Annabella was inexorable. She had worked
herself into that state of passion in which remonstrance
seems to have no effect but that of adding
fuel to the flame. The storm of anger was less
intolerable to her spirit than the state of doubt and
self-reproach, which, like a chill, dark mist was
falling on her soul, when the words of Mrs. Aumerle
roused her from remorse to sudden resentment. The
countess determined to seek the dwelling of Bardon,
where she felt assured of a welcome, and where she
would remain, as she declared, till she had formed
arrangements with friends in London. It was, perhaps,
unfortunate that Annabella had sufficient
resources of her own to render her in pecuniary concerns
quite independent of others. She had just
arrived at the age which gave her free disposal of
these resources, though it had certainly not proved,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
in her case, to be an age of discretion. It was foreseeing
the difficulties and dangers that must beset
the wealthy and wilful girl, whose vanity would
render her the ready dupe of interested flatterers,
that had made the vicar anxious to keep her beside
him, until the kindly offices of mutual friends should
re-unite her to her husband. This was now impossible.
Annabella, closing her ears to remonstrance,
and her heart to tenderness, quitted the home of her
uncle with an expressed determination never to
revisit it again. She would not even suffer her
cousins to accompany her, but with sullen resolution
set out on her lonely walk.</p>

<p>Ida watched her receding figure with a very heavy
heart. “It might have been so different,” she murmured
to herself; “her heart was touched, her pride
was giving way, when—” and turning towards the
spot where her step-mother stood, Ida could not
refrain from the exclamation, “it was your coming
that changed all!” Without lingering for a reply
to the hastily spoken word, Ida sought solitude in
the quiet arbour where she had, as we have seen,
held converse with her sister upon subjects high and
holy. Ida’s only companions now were bitter meditations.
She had reproached her father’s wife, but
was her own conscience clear even as regarded Annabella?
Ida recalled with deep distress her own misgivings
on the day on which the countess must have
written her fatal paper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>“If I had only spoken to her then,—if I had
only pleaded with her then, before the irrevocable
step had been taken, oh! it would never have come
to this!” and with the anguish of unavailing regret,
Ida Aumerle mourned over her sin of omission.</p>

<span class="smaller">CONSCIENCE ASLEEP.</span></h2>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Those, however, who having no such plea to urge, are envious, sour, discontented,
irritable, uncharitable, have good ground to suspect the genuineness of
their Christianity. Grace sweetens while it sanctifies.”—<span class="smcap">Guthrie.</span></p>

</div>

<p>How wide a difference do we find to exist between
the consciences of those who hold the same faith,
and profess to be governed by the same commandments!
To some—sin appears like the speck on a
bridal robe, a disfiguring blot seen at a glance, which
offends the eye, and to remove which every means
at once must be taken. To others—it is a thing as
little to be marked as the same speck on a dark,
time-worn garment. The possessor wears it with
an easy mind, perhaps all unconscious of the stain!</p>

<p>Thus while Ida grieved at the recollection of that
false delicacy or hidden pride, that had made her
shrink from intruding herself upon her cousin at a
time when her presence might have been of essential
service, Bardon felt not the least self-reproach for
the evil counsel which he had given to the countess.
It was to him merely a subject of pleasant speculation
whether she would follow it or not, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
was extremely impatient for the day when the
appearance of the next number of the —— Magazine
would set all his doubts to rest. Bardon longed to
see a good home-thrust at the pride of Reginald,
Earl of Dashleigh. The mortification of the peer—his
confusion—his indignation—was a subject upon
which the imagination of the doctor actually feasted,
for he had never forgotten or forgiven the words
that he had overheard at the Hall.</p>

<p>And yet Bardon was not considered a bad man
nor was he such as the word is commonly understood.
He was an honest, upright man; a steady
friend, an earnest patriot, one who felt for the sufferings
of the poor, though he had little power to
relieve them. And Bardon was to a certain extent
religious, at least in his own opinion. He read and
venerated his Bible, constantly attended his church,
and had persecution arisen, would have been a
martyr of the cause of truth.</p>

<p>But Bardon’s religion did not pervade his spirit,
it did not leaven his temper. It left him as jealous,
irritable, and vindictive, as if he had never heard of
a gospel of peace!</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“In yonder vase replenished by the shower</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Pour the rich wine; it spreads as it descends,</div>
<div class="verse">Pervades the whole, and with mysterious power</div>
<div class="verse indent1">To every drop its hue and sweetness lends!</div>
<div class="verse">Thus should religion’s influence serene</div>
<div class="verse">Be felt in all our thoughts, in all our actions seen!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But it was not thus with Timon Bardon. He could
repeat the Lord’s prayer,—did repeat it twice every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
day, without once starting at the thought, that he
was in it constantly invoking a curse on his own
vindictive soul! Forgive us our trespasses, <em>as we
forgive them that trespass against us</em>! Was that a
prayer for one who treasured up the memory of a
wrong far more jealously than that of a benefit? for
one who prided himself on being “a good hater;”
and who spoke of “the sweetness of revenge?”
Bardon reprobated with indignation the mean vices
of covetousness, falsehood, or fraud,—he was ready
to call down fire from heaven on the tyrant, the
traitor, or the thief; but he granted, in his own
person, a plenary indulgence, a perfect tolerance to
pride, hatred, malice, revenge—sins as destructive
to the soul as the darkest of those which he condemned.</p>

<p>Bardon was too poor to be a subscriber to the
—— Magazine; but he was always allowed a
reading of that which was taken in at the Vicarage,
and, indeed, Aumerle, though his friend little guessed
the fact, subscribed chiefly on account of the doctor.
But Bardon was far too impatient to know whether
the countess had written in this Number, to endure
waiting for a second day’s reading. He did not
choose to go to the Vicarage to betray his eagerness
there, but he resolved to walk the whole six
miles to Pelton, in order to purchase a copy for
himself.</p>

<p>“You must have pressing business indeed at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
town, papa, to walk so far in the sun on such a warm
day as this!” cried Cecilia in a tone of expostulation,
as she fanned herself with a languid air. “I’m
sure that the heat will kill you.”</p>

<p>“Not so easily killed,” said the doctor gaily;
“there’s nothing like air and exercise for keeping a
man in health.”</p>

<p>“You have received a call to some patient?” said
Cecilia, encouraged by his cheerfulness to venture
upon a subject which was usually forbidden, for
Bardon’s patients were “few and far between.”</p>

<p>“There’s one who won’t prove patient, I guess,”
replied Bardon inwardly chuckling at the joke.</p>

<p>His mind was so full of his errand that, though
the road was extremely dusty, and the sun shot down
fervid rays, Bardon was scarcely conscious either of
discomfort or fatigue. He walked on as briskly as
if the frost of December braced his nerves and
rendered rapid motion necessary. Bardon was glad,
however, when his journey drew near its end, and
he reached the High Street of Pelton, with its rows
of tidy shops, to one of which—the library—he now
bent his eager steps. He glanced rapidly over the
window in hopes to recognise the well-known cover
of the —— Magazine amongst prints, envelopes,
and daily papers; it was not, however, to be seen,
and Bardon entered the library.</p>

<p>There was at first no one sufficiently disengaged
to be able to attend to the doctor, and Bardon had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
to wait with what patience he could muster, taking
off his hat, and wiping his heated forehead, and looking
around him, but in vain, for the Number which
he had walked so far to see.</p>

<p>“Warm morning, sir,” said the librarian, turning
to the doctor at last, as a party of customers quitted
the shop.</p>

<p>“The last Number of the —— Magazine!” cried
Bardon, waving superfluous comment on the weather,
and flinging down a coin on the counter.</p>

<p>“Well, sir,” said the shopkeeper with a smile, “if
you had called but five minutes ago I could have
accommodated you with a copy; but there’s been
such a run on the Magazine to-day, that really I
have not one left. You see, sir,” he added, “there’s an
article in it that takes with the public amazingly,—something
that’s said to be a hit on one of the leading
men in the county; and,” here he lowered his
voice, “people who are wiser than their neighbours
think that they’ve a pretty good guess as to the pen
that wrote it. Anything else this morning, sir?”</p>

<p>Bardon uttered his emphatic “No!” and hurried
out of the shop. “She’s done it!” he muttered to
himself; “I’d give anything to see her paper!”</p>

<p>At the corner of the street a baker’s boy and a gentleman’s
page were standing together, laughing at
something which the latter held in his hand, and
which his companion was perusing over his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Now, ain’t that good?” exclaimed he of the
bread-basket, showing his teeth from ear to ear.</p>

<p>Bardon caught a glimpse of what they were reading.
“My lads,” he cried, “I’ll pay you for that;
give the magazine to me,” and he held out the price
for the Number.</p>

<p>“It’s my master’s,” said the page, as if awakened
to a sudden sense of the responsibility connected
with green cloth and gilt buttons; and rolling up the
coveted Number, he hurried on his way to make up
for the time which he had lost.</p>

<p>The doctor stopped and reflected. “Mrs. Clayton,
the major’s blind widow, she is likely to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
in the —— Magazine. I have not called on the
old dame for years, but shell not take a visit amiss.
I think that the house with green blinds is hers, and
I am certain to find her at home.”</p>

<p>Dr. Bardon was not disappointed this time. The
blind old lady, who lived a dull and solitary life, was
charmed to welcome an old acquaintance, and her
visitor was yet more pleased to behold the desired
periodical on the table half covered by the supplement
of yesterday’s <cite>Times</cite>.</p>

<p>After the first greetings were over, and inquiries
after his “sweet child Caroline,” (for the lady’s memory
was not particularly clear as to the name or age
of Cecilia,) the doctor seated himself by the blind
lady, laughing loud to cover the rustle as he drew
the Magazine from under the paper, and then impatiently
turned over the leaves. His object was to
read the article; Mrs. Clayton’s was to obtain a medical
opinion gratis upon the maladies with which she
was, or fancied herself to be troubled. She proceeded,
therefore, quite uninterrupted by her supposed
auditor, with a long story of rheumatism and relaxed
throat, the various remedies which she had tried
for these evils, and the dubious success of each application;
the eager reader giving an occasional grunt
of assent, to save appearances, until the invalid
paused in her narration.</p>

<p>“Indeed, doctor, I’m beginning to think that the air
of Pelton don’t agree with me; I begin to feel myself—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hanging between earth and sky, like the fabled
coffin of Mahomet!” muttered the doctor, who in
his interest in what he was perusing, had almost forgotten
the presence of her whose faint, complaining
voice sounded like a trickling rill in his ear.</p>

<p>“What is he saying about coffins and hanging?”
thought the poor invalid. “It is very shocking to
suggest such horrible ideas to a nervous creature like
me!”</p>

<p>As the doctor did not seem disposed to add to his
incomprehensible communication, Mrs. Clayton proceeded
on with her melancholy story.</p>

<p>“Last winter my cough was so bad, that Mrs.
Graham (you know Mrs. Graham, her daughter
married a Bagot), she recommended me to take cochlico
lozenges. I sent up all the way to London,
there’s only one shop there that sells them, in one
particular street, and I got a parcel of them down by
the post. But I assure you, doctor, that they did
me no good. I think that I must have caught a
chill by venturing out in March; you know what the
east winds are, doctor; I really had not a wink of
sleep at night,—I actually thought my cough would
have torn me to pieces.”</p>

<p>At this point the reader burst into an irrepressible
chuckle of delight, and as he closed the Magazine
exclaimed, “Capital! capital!” to the no small
amazement of the sufferer. Her lengthened silence
of surprise made Bardon,—whose hand was now on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
the supplement of the <cite>Times</cite>, aware that it was necessary
to say something; and as he had a vague idea
that her talk had been a series of complaints, he
cried, hap-hazard, as his eye ran on the list of deaths,
“Very bad! very bad! I’m certain that you indulge
in green tea!”—</p>

<p>“Oh! well, I sometimes—”</p>

<p>“Can it be!” muttered Bardon, gazing with stern
interest at one of the names which appeared in the
gloomy column.</p>

<p>“Do you think, doctor, that there is much
harm?”</p>

<p>“Death!” exclaimed Timon Bardon to himself.</p>

<p>“Surely you don’t mean it,”—cried the old lady,
and the doctor was again recalled by her voice to
what was passing around him.</p>

<p>“If you drink green tea,” he cried, starting from his
seat and pushing the paper to the other end of the
table, “I won’t answer for your living out the
year!” and with a very brief good-bye, Timon
hurried away, leaving the poor lady to complain to
her next visitor, that Dr. Bardon was so brusque
and so odd that he was just like an east wind in
March, and that she was not in the least surprised
that his practice was not extensive, as if he did not
kill his patients with his medicine, he was likely to
do so with his manner!</p>

<p>What was it that Bardon had seen in the <cite>Times</cite><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
that interested him as strongly as even the article
written by Annabella at his own suggestion? He
had seen the announcement of the death of “Mr.
Auger, of —— Street and Nettleby Tower,” of the
man who had ruined his prospects—who had
wrested from the disinherited son the estate which his
ancestors for centuries had held. Death should still
the emotion of hatred, hush the voice of revenge; but
it is to be feared that in this instance the advertisement,
casually seen, rather increased than diminished
the stern satisfaction felt by the vindictive old man.
It seemed to Bardon as if he were triumphing at
once over a dead and a living foe. As he proceeded
on his long walk homewards, he certainly never
questioned himself as to his lack of the charity which
<em>rejoiceth not in iniquity</em>, or he would not have
revelled as he did in the idea that it was he who
had incited the countess to take such petty revenge
on her husband. Nor did Bardon, as he reflected on
the death of his hated supplanter, recall to mind the
warning of the royal Preacher, <em>Rejoice not when thine
enemy falleth, and let not thy heart be glad when he
stumbleth</em>, or he would scarcely have muttered to
himself with a gloomy smile, that six feet of earth
would be now estate large enough for the late owner
of Nettleby Tower.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the engrossing nature of his
thoughts, the doctor on his return to his home could
not avoid feeling the way long and the weather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
oppressive. He could scarcely drag on his weary
limbs when at length he reached the little gate of
the garden which surrounded Mill Cottage.</p>

<p>Cecilia ran out to meet him in a flutter of excitement
and joy.</p>

<p>“O! Papa! only guess who has come here while
you were away!”</p>

<p>“How can I tell!” said the tired man sharply.</p>

<p>“The countess! the dear delightful countess herself,
and she says—” but Doctor Bardon waited to
hear no more, and forgetful of fatigue, hurried into
the cottage.</p>

<p>Annabella came forward to meet him, and in a few
brief sentences explained to him her situation, and
her wish to remain no longer under the roof of her
uncle the vicar. As she had expected, the doctor
gave her a cordial welcome, and pressed her to
remain at his home for as long a period as might
suit her convenience. He was proud to be able to
exercise hospitality, and though he would never have
pleaded guilty to the charge, was by no means insensible
to the honour of entertaining a woman distinguished
both by her rank and her talents. Would
it not also be an additional mortification to the
detested earl, to know that the Countess of Dashleigh
was the guest at a cottage scarcely larger than
his gamekeeper’s lodge!</p>

<p>As for Cecilia, she was in ecstasies. The presence
of a real countess seemed to her actually to glorify<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
the little abode, and her only misery was the difficulty
of providing suitable accommodation for such an
illustrious visitor. The cottage she had often termed
“nothing but a bandbox,” and though poor Miss
Bardon was willing to put herself into any straits,
empty out all her drawers, squeeze herself and her
wardrobe into any corner, it required a wonderful
amount of ingenuity to make the titled guest and
her maid tolerably comfortable in the tiny tenement.
Cecilia not only used every effort to stimulate to
exertion her old deaf domestic, but herself worked
hard in secret to prepare her own room for the
countess. She ruthlessly sacrificed a white muslin
robe for the adornment of the toilette table, cut up
her best bow to loop it up with ribbon, and even
ventured to invade her father’s garden to ornament
the apartment with flowers.</p>

<p>Annabella had little idea of the amount of trouble
and excitement which she was causing, nor how
heavily the expense of hospitality would press on
her proud but poor entertainers. While the countess
was conversing in the sitting room with the
doctor, Bates arrived with her lady’s boxes, and was
ordered to carry them up to her apartment. The
maid surprised poor Cecilia on her knees, industriously
stitching up a hole in a worn-out drugget,
her face flushed and heated with the unwonted occupation.
Miss Bardon started up in some confusion,
her pride deeply mortified at being found in a position,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
and engaged in an employment so unbefitting a
fine lady, which it was her ambition always to appear.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 420px;" id="illus4">

<p class="caption">An Unwelcome Surprise.</p>
<p class="caption-r"><a href="#Page_168"><i>Page 168.</i></a></p>
</div>

<p>Bates looked round with wondering contempt on
the miserable hovel, as she deemed it, which her
young mistress had chosen in preference to the
luxurious apartments of Dashleigh Hall. The lady’s
maid had serious doubts as to whether she could so
compromise her own dignity as to remain in a house
where no “footman was kept.” To share a pigeon-hole
seven feet square with a deaf and stupid maid-of-all-work,
who could not even listen to her
gossip,—did ever devoted lady’s maid submit to such
hardship before! Annabella, on her part, found
fault with nothing, never appeared to notice any
difficulties, and accommodated herself to cottage life
as if she had been accustomed to it from her childhood.</p>

<p>“There is not a particle of pride in her!” exclaimed
the admiring Cecilia, as she had done upon a
previous occasion.</p>

<p>The announcement that our sovereign Lady herself
had resolved to take a bird’s-eye view of her dominions
from the clouds, could hardly have created a greater
sensation in the county of Somersetshire, than the
rumour, presently confirmed “by authority,” that the
Earl of Dashleigh was to be one of the ærial travellers
in the <i>Eaglet</i>. From the squire to the swineherd,
every one within a circuit of many miles was full of
the strange report. The nobleman’s motive for attempting
the feat was palpable to all who had read
or heard of “The Precipice and the Peer;” and speculation
was rife, and heavy bets were exchanged as to
whether the hero of the Swiss adventure would ever
summon up sufficient courage to mount aloft in a
balloon.</p>

<p>The rumour reached the dwelling of the Bardons.
The doctor elevated his bushy black brows, and drew
in his lips as if to whistle; while Cecilia stole a
glance at the countess to see the effect of the announcement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
upon her. Annabella changed colour,
but affected to believe the report absurd, and dismissed
the subject at once from her discourse if not
from her thoughts. But from that hour the young
wife’s manner became reserved and gloomy. She
made no effort to keep up conversation, did not seem
to hear questions addressed to her, or if she heard,
gave her replies at random. She would scarcely
touch at table the delicate food procured for her with
trouble and expense. Cecilia in vain taxed her brain
to find something that a peeress could eat, and the
doctor brought vegetables from his garden which he
believed that Covent Garden could not equal, to see
them lie untasted on the plate of his silent guest.</p>

<p>Under any other circumstances the temper of the
old lion would have given way, but the report of
Dashleigh’s intended exploit had filled him with
malignant delight. Bardon felt assured that the
spirit of the adventurous peer would fail him when
put to the proof, and so eager was the doctor to
enjoy this expected new source of humiliation to his
foe, that he resolved to accept Augustine’s invitation
after all, and make one of the spectators who should
witness the ascent of the <i>Eaglet</i>.</p>

<p>Poor Cecilia, however, who had no such secret
source of satisfaction,—who would, of course, be constrained
to remain at home with her guest, and see
nothing of the gaiety at Aspendale, began to suspect
that even the honour of entertaining a peeress might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
be purchased at too high a price. Annabella now
took no pains to flatter the little vanity of her
hostess; never even glanced admiringly at her elaborate
dress, never asked her to touch the guitar, praised
nothing, smiled at nothing, seemed really to care for
nothing; while the poor lady of the cottage scarcely
dared to think what her father would say when the
tradesmen should send in their formidable bills!</p>

<p>Amongst those who were most startled by the
news that Dashleigh had decided on ascending with
his friend, was the aspirant to the same perilous distinction,
the enthusiastic Mabel Aumerle. The warm
champion of the wife doubted at first whether she
could consistently make one in a party in which the
tyrant husband was to appear. But Mabel did not
long waver in doubt. Her desire to share her uncle’s
excursion was too intense to be easily damped.</p>

<p>“I need have nothing to say to the earl,” she
observed, “even if sitting in the car by his side.
My uncle has a right to invite whom he pleases, and
I have none to find fault with his selection. Besides,
I daresay when it comes to the point, that the nervous
earl will find some excuse for not ascending at
all.”</p>

<p>Mabel might have added that late events had
shown her that her admired countess had not the
right altogether on her side. With all her spirit of
partisanship, Mabel could not defend “The Precipice
and the Peer,” and she was hurt and almost offended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
at the abrupt manner in which her cousin had quitted
the vicarage. On the whole, therefore, Mabel decided
that no reason existed to prevent her doing her
utmost to persuade her indulgent father to permit
her to join the æronauts in their excursion through
the realms of air.</p>

<p>The vicar and his wife, on hearing of the earl’s
intention to be at Aspendale, at once relinquished
their purpose of going thither themselves. They
felt that there would be an awkwardness in meeting
him in society after receiving his disobedient young
wife into their house. Ida, also, for more than one
reason, declined her uncle’s invitation. But to Mabel
staying away upon such an occasion would have been
a disappointment which the whole amount of her
philosophy would not have enabled her to bear; and
Augustine therefore arranged to drive over for his
youngest niece early on the morning of the eventful
12th of May.</p>

<p>“Ida, dearest,” exclaimed Mabel on the evening
preceding the long-desired day, “do you know that
at last, after coaxing,—such hard, such persevering
coaxing,—I have really managed to get a sort of
consent from Papa to my going up in the <i>Eaglet</i>! I
took his arm as he was walking up and down upon
the lawn, and I was so persuasive, so irresistible, I
told him so much about Mr. Verdon, and how he
could manage a balloon just as easily as I manage a
pony,—that at last convinced—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>“Or tired out,” suggested Ida,—</p>

<p>“He said to me, with his dear kind smile, ‘I don’t
forbid your going, my child, but you must ask your
mother’s opinion about it.’ O Ida! I could have
danced for joy! What a kiss I gave him for the
permission! There never was so kind a father as he!”</p>

<p>“But you had a condition to fulfil,” observed Ida,
“which must have moderated your delight.”</p>

<p>“Yes; I am not fond of asking any one’s opinion,
above all, that of—well, don’t look so grave, dear
Mentor, I won’t say anything to shock you; but to
think of Papa’s calling her my <em>mother</em>! Off I flew
to Mrs. Aumerle, eager as a bird on the wing. I
found her in her store-room, measuring out tea and
sugar, soap and candles. ‘Mrs. Aumerle,’ I cried,
without waiting to get my breath, ‘Papa does not
forbid my going up in the car of the <i>Eaglet</i> with my
uncle, but he desires me to ask your—’ The old
horror did not even give me time to finish my sentence.
‘Mabel,’ she said, looking as prim as that
poker, ‘once for all, I tell you I will never give my
consent to your doing so ridiculous a thing;’ but
she was overshooting her mark,” continued Mabel,
laughing gaily, “papa told me to ask her <em>opinion</em>,
and not her <em>consent</em>,—there’s a mighty difference
between the two.”</p>

<p>“But, Mabel, when Mrs. Aumerle positively forbids
you to go—”</p>

<p>“She’s not my mother!” cried Mabel quickly;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
“I’m not bound to yield obedience to her. You do
not do so yourself. Did not Mrs. Aumerle tell you
to have nothing more to do with the woman at the
toll, and yet you gave her some tea and warm flannel
the very next day!”</p>

<p>“But, Mabel, I thought that the woman was misjudged
and hardly treated, and—”</p>

<p>“She turned out to be a hypocrite, you know;
but that is nothing to the point. The question is,—whether
you and I are to be lorded over by Mrs.
Aumerle? whether we are forced to obey any one
but our own dear father?”</p>

<p>Ida knew not what to reply; for had she counselled
strict obedience to her step-mother, she too well
knew that her practice would contradict her preaching.</p>

<p>“Ah! you think just as I do,” cried Mabel; “we
ought to be civil and attentive to Mrs. Aumerle for
the sake of peace, and to please Papa, but we need
not be ruled by her commands.”</p>

<p>“In the present case,” said Ida, avoiding the point
of discussion, “I think that our step-mother may be
right. I should not be easy if you were to be exposed
to the slightest danger.”</p>

<p>“Danger! nonsense!” cried Mabel; “when this
is Mr. Verdon’s fifteenth ascent, and we are to come
down in a couple of hours! Why, even the earl,
with his sensitive nerves, does not fear to ascend!”</p>

<p>“And yet I cannot help dreading—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ida, Ida,” exclaimed Mabel, putting her hand playfully
before the lips of her sister, “you have no voice
in the matter; Papa never told me to ask your consent
or even your opinion. If he see no danger,
why should you? You would never be so unkind, so
dreadfully unkind, as to prevent my having what
would be to me the greatest enjoyment in the world!”</p>

<p>Mabel said a great deal more which it is not
necessary here to repeat, to remove every lingering
objection which might be felt by her sister. Ida
disliked the idea of the excursion, though half convinced
by Mabel’s arguments that there was no real
cause for apprehension; but in her opposition she
did not take her stand on the only tenable ground,—that
of the duty of submission to lawful authority.
Ida, with all her gentleness and tenderness of conscience,
felt as strong a repugnance as her sister to
bowing to the judgment of the woman to whom her
sympathies so little inclined. She constantly repeated
to herself that their natures and their spheres were
different, and that the step-mother and step-daughters
might each pursue their own course of usefulness
without interfering with one another. Ida would
be on the footing rather of a friendly ally than that
of a dependent subject of the mistress of her father’s
house. Pride had not lost his hold upon the gentle,
self-sacrificing Christian.</p>

<p>Mabel was very glad that during the evening the
conversation of the family circle turned rather upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
Annabella and her husband than on her own share
in the morrow’s balloon expedition; she was so fearful
lest anything should be said to induce her father to
revoke his extorted permission to her to ascend in
the car.</p>

<p>When the young ladies had retired for the night,
the vicar said to his wife, “Did Mabel ask your consent,
my dear, to the excursion on which her heart
is so greatly set?” (the father, it may be observed,
did not draw the nice distinction upon which Mabel
had insisted between opinion and consent.)</p>

<p>“She did,” replied the lady, folding up her work,
“and I put an extinguisher at once upon the project.”</p>

<p>“You did?” said the vicar thoughtfully; “well, I
daresay, my love, you were right.”</p>

<p>It was with a sensation of delightful expectation
that Mabel Aumerle rose on the following morning.
The sun rising over the distant hills was scarcely so
early as she. Mabel could hardly believe that the
long-expected day was actually come, on which her
most delightful dream of hope was to be fully
realized!</p>

<p>No one else in the vicarage was stirring when the
young girl crept softly from the house, for her spirit
felt so blythe and elastic that it could only expand in
freedom under the open vault of heaven. How
deliciously fresh was the breath of morn! Mabel
gazed at the light clouds above her, and almost
shouted for joy at the thought that in a few hours
she would be winging her way amongst them, no
more chained down as a captive to earth. She would
no longer envy the little bird, pouring his carol down
from the sky—she would soar yet higher than he!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>Mabel lingered about the garden for nearly two
hours, too much excited to settle for a moment to
any quiet occupation. She was troubled by nothing
but the fever of impatience, and the fear that something
might occur to stop her expected treat. She
ever and anon looked anxiously towards the house;
as long as Mrs. Aumerle’s shutters were closed, Mabel
retained a feeling of security; but as soon as she saw
them open, the eager girl determined to go a little
way on the road by which her uncle was to come,
“to meet him and prevent delay,” as she said to
herself, but really to give opportunity to no one to
object to her ascent in the <i>Eaglet</i>.</p>

<p>How quiet the road appeared! how thick lay the
diamond dew on the sward that fringed it! how
bright and cheerful all nature looked to the rejoicing
eye of Mabel! Yet her uncle seemed to her to take
a wearisome time in coming. The minutes were
terribly long, and the impatient girl could scarcely
believe the testimony of the village church clock
when it struck only the number eight.</p>

<p>“I think that the morning will never end!” exclaimed
Mabel; “I was foolish to rise so early. But
see,—see,—surely there is a gig coming at last down
the hill,—and that is my uncle driving; I should
know Black Prince miles off, he trots down at so
dashing a pace! O uncle!” she cried, running
forward to meet him, “it seemed as if you never
would come!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m not late,” said Augustine, reining up his
horse, whose black hide was flecked with foam; “we
shall be back in good time for breakfast. Up with
you!” and Mabel, with eager pleasure, mounted to
the seat at his side.</p>

<p>“Shall I just wish them good morning at the
vicarage, and see if Ida has changed her mind?”</p>

<p>“Oh no! pray don’t,” said Mabel uneasily, “I am
certain that Ida would not come.”</p>

<p>“Well, then we had better be off for Aspendale,
and not keep Verdon waiting for breakfast,” cried
Augustine, backing his horse up to the hedge to turn
his head round on the narrow road.</p>

<p>“How good you are to come all this way for me!”
said Mabel. “And so Mr. Verdon has really arrived,
and the balloon, is it all right—all ready?”</p>

<p>“It will be ready by the time that our guests
arrive,” replied her uncle, lightly shaking the rein,
and touching his steed with the whip, “Have you
leave to ascend with us, Mabel?”</p>

<p>“Yes; Papa’s leave, at least,” she replied. “Oh!
how delightful it is to go driving on at this pace;
but it will be far more delightful still to go scudding
aloft before the breeze!”</p>

<p>“Is not that Bardon’s cottage?” asked Augustine,
as they dashed past a little tenement. Mabel gave
an affirmative reply.</p>

<p>“I had had some thought,” observed her uncle,
“of calling for Dr. Bardon; but I confess that, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
what has past, I feel somewhat disgusted at his
coming at all. There is a singular want of good
taste in his showing himself at this time to Dashleigh.”</p>

<p>“Surely the doctor is not going in the balloon!”
exclaimed Mabel.</p>

<p>“No, no, not quite so bad as that,” answered
Augustine with a smile; “I could not undertake to
carry up lion and bear in one car, even with my fair
niece to help me to keep the peace between them.”</p>

<p>“But do you believe,” asked Mabel, “that the
earl will really ascend?”</p>

<p>Augustine’s handsome countenance became grave.
“He must do something, poor fellow,” he observed,
“to efface from the minds of men the remembrance
of that mischievous squib.”</p>

<p>“But if he be really so timid—”</p>

<p>“Reginald has no want of courage,” said Augustine
Aumerle, with unusual warmth in his manner;
“I have seen him plunge into a rapid stream to save
a drowning child; and when we were boys together,
I have known him fight a bully who was twice as
strong as himself. Certainly he never could climb a
tree,” added the friend in a more thoughtful tone.</p>

<p>“And he played a poor figure on the mountain,
according to ‘The Precipice and the Peer,’” said
Mabel.</p>

<p>“There was a great deal of exaggeration in that
piece; any one could see that,” replied Augustine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
“It contained the very essence of malicious satire.
I don’t know what could have possessed the countess
to write it.”</p>

<p>“Pride, I suppose,” answered Mabel.</p>

<p>“Detestable pride!” muttered her uncle.</p>

<p>“But do you not think that they will be one day
reconciled to each other? Annabella has so much
that is noble in her; she is so generous and affectionate,—and
you seem to have a good opinion of
the earl.”</p>

<p>“The mischief is,” replied Augustine, “that he is
as proud as she. No, I fear that neither will ever
yield, and that this grievous separation will last as
long as their lives.”</p>

<p>Mabel and her uncle soon arrived at Aspendale
Lodge, a lonely but comfortable dwelling, picturesquely
situated on the slope of a wooded hill, with
a large meadow spangled with daisies and buttercups
behind it, from which the ascent was to take place.</p>

<p>Augustine helped Mabel to alight, and then leading
her into his house, introduced her to Mr. Verdon,
a small, lightly-built man, with sharp features, and
an appearance of remarkable intelligence in his keen
grey eyes. Mabel was so eager to see the balloon
that she could not wait until she had partaken of
the breakfast to which her drive and early rising
had disposed her to do full justice, but hurried into
the back field.</p>

<p>The huge ball was not yet inflated, but Mabel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
looked with interest on the inert mass, which was so
soon to rise as if instinct with life, and was full of
eager questions, which the goodnatured æronaut, himself
an enthusiast on the subject, took a pleasure in
answering.</p>

<p>The breakfast was a very cheerful meal. Augustine
had such a vast intellectual store always at his
command, and Vernon was so completely master of
the theme then most interesting to Mabel, that she
listened, and occasionally joined in the conversation
with the most keen delight. Then when the breakfast
was concluded, and preparations were begun for
inflating the balloon with gas, Mabel joyously flitted
from meadow to hall, from hall to meadow, now
watching Mr. Verdon’s operations, now superintending
those of the housekeeper, busy in laying out the
elegant collation which Augustine had ordered for
his guests. Mabel was in her element, in her glory!
She was to do the honours of her uncle’s house, receive
her uncle’s guests; and this to a lively girl of
fifteen was a dignity of no common order!</p>

<p>As carriage after carriage arrived, Mabel welcomed
every new comer, imitating Ida’s manner as well as
her overflowing spirits would let her. It was her
chief pleasure to tell every friend whom she knew,
that she herself was to go in the balloon, to hear this
one marvel at her courage, and that one envy her
rare fortune,—to feel herself something of a heroine,
an object of attention to those around her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Bardon was one of the earliest arrivals at
Aspendale Lodge. His first question was, “Has the
earl come?”</p>

<p>Mabel replied, “Not yet;” and he gave a malicious
smile.</p>

<p>“What does the countess say to this?” inquired
Mabel; “did she know that you were coming to the
Lodge?”</p>

<p>“I can scarcely make out what she knows or
does not know, what she likes or does not like,”
said the doctor gruffly; “but I suspect she’ll look
out for the balloon. The wind, I see, is from the
east; ’twill bear you in the direction of Mill
Cottage.”</p>

<p>The circle of guests would now have been complete,
but for the non-arrival of one. That one was
most eagerly watched for. The oft-repeated question,
“Has the earl come?” was now exchanged for
another, “Will the earl come?” and jests were made,
and bets were laid, while every minute that elapsed
added to the impatience of the party.</p>

<p>A large concourse of people had gathered in a
neighbouring field, drawn from a circuit of many
miles to see the ascent of the <i>Eaglet</i>. Ayrton had
sent its labourers, Pelton its shopboys and mechanics;
the ploughman had left his team, and merry farmers’
wives had forsaken their dairies, and come with their
children and grandchildren to witness the wonderful
sight. The hedge which surrounded Augustine’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
meadow was lined and double lined with the eager
heads of such spectators as these, while around the
balloon itself gathered a brilliant circle of gaily-dressed
guests, privileged to occupy a nearer place.</p>

<p>The great striped ball had now been swelled to
its utmost dimensions, and swayed gently to and fro,
as if luxuriating in the sense of power, only restrained
by a number of strong ropes from bursting upwards
towards the skies.</p>

<p>“It is like swollen pride,” observed Mabel, “impatient
to mount aloft.”</p>

<p>“And puffed out with the idea of its importance,
like the fools of this world,” added the doctor; “but,”
he continued with a sardonic sneer, “good strong cords
of prudence will keep the most aspiring down!”</p>

<p>Augustine was annoyed at the sarcasm, and the
pretty general remark now occasioned by the non-arrival
of Dashleigh. Mr. Verdon had quite completed
his preparations. In the gaily painted wicker
car, ornamented with little fluttering flags, the ballast
had been carefully placed, together with the
grappling irons, a case of instruments to be used by
Augustine for scientific purposes, and “last, not least,”
a basket containing some refreshments, and two
bottles of sparkling champagne.</p>

<p>Mabel was becoming almost wild with impatience,
when suddenly the heads of the outside spectators
were turned round in an opposite direction from that
of the balloon, and then hats and handkerchiefs waved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
in the air, and cheer after cheer from the rural crowd
announced to the more select circle that the long-expected
was coming at last. Presently a chariot,
with servants in red liveries, and a coronet on the
panel, dashed up the hill to Aspendale Lodge! Mabel
could not refrain from clapping her hands. “He is
come! he is come!” the murmur ran through the
crowd, and the guests assembled in the meadow
simultaneously directed their gaze towards the house.
Augustine, with a sense of relief, hurried in to greet
his illustrious guest at the front entrance. After the
lapse of some minutes he emerged from the dwelling,
and crossed his back garden on his way to the
meadow; while at his side, pale and silent as a
corpse, walked Reginald, Earl of Dashleigh.</p>

<p>Has the reader ever pictured to himself what, at the
time of the Reign of Terror, must have been the
emotions of some noble victim borne towards the
fatal guillotine? Imagine the sensations of some
nobleman, fostered in the lap of luxury, accustomed
to every indulgence, full of the pride of birth, when
the rolling death-cart brings him suddenly in view
of the horrible engine of destruction, and the dense
crowd of eager spectators assembled to witness his
cruel end! A sense of personal dignity struggles
with that of mortal fear. He must not show the
inward agony that chills his shuddering frame; he
must be firm and calm before the gaze of those
thousand curious eyes; and yet the horror of that
hour almost overcomes his self-command, and he
fears that his resolution may give way in the fiery
trial!</p>

<p>He who can realize to himself this picture, will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
able to enter into the sensations of the unhappy
earl, when from his carriage window he first beheld
the huge globe, towering high above the surrounding
crowd, and heard the sound of the cheers which
greeted his own tardy appearance on the spot. The
vain hopes which he had clung to vanished in a
moment from his mind. Mr. Verdon had not disappointed
his friend,—no accident had marred the
balloon in its transit to Augustine’s house; no, there
it was ready, quivering as if with eager joy to welcome
its victim! How Dashleigh would have blessed
any mischievous urchin who should, by fire or steel,
have clipped for ever the wings of the <i>Eaglet</i>!</p>

<p>Let it not be supposed, however, that the Earl of
Dashleigh was a coward. The testimony borne by
Augustine Aumerle had been simply just. As a
soldier the earl would have done his duty, and earned
an honourable name; he would not have blenched
on a field of battle, and if wounded, would have endured
in silence the anguish caused by the probe or
the knife. But his physical constitution was such
that he could hardly look down from the height of
an ordinary wall without a giddy sensation. His
head seemed to turn round on the brink of a chasm,
and the horror of falling down a precipice haunted
him even in his dreams! It was not to be wondered
at that to such a man the idea of gazing down thousands
of feet from the clouds was fraught with unutterable
terror; and the earl looked so ill when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
Augustine Aumerle came forth from the door to
meet him, that his friend involuntarily exclaimed,
“Dashleigh! you are not fit to ascend!”</p>

<p>“I must, I must,” was the muttered reply, as with
an ice-cold hand the earl returned the grasp of his
host.</p>

<p>“Come first into the house and refresh yourself; I
am certain that you are not well;” and so saying,
Augustine led the way into a room where a cold collation
had been spread out for his guests.</p>

<p>The earl walked up to the table, poured out a
quantity of wine into a tumbler, and took it off at a
draught. Augustine feared that there might be some
risk that his friend would dull his intellect in the
hope of strengthening his nerves.</p>

<p>The two then proceeded, as we have seen, through
the garden into the meadow. The earl acknowledged
the salutations of his acquaintance by stiffly bending
his head, but never uttered a word.</p>

<p>“Will you go back?” whispered Augustine, who
began to feel uneasy as to the result of the experiment
before him.</p>

<p>The earl hesitated for an instant, only an instant;
he caught sight of Dr. Bardon, watching him with a
sarcastic smile on his face, which stung the proud
noble like a scorpion; pushing forward with a determined
effort, Reginald sprung into the car in which
Mabel, with girlish impatience, had already taken
her place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now we only want Verdon,” observed Augustine,
more leisurely following his companion; “he is busy
giving last orders, but he will be with us in a
minute.”</p>

<p>“And then, skyward ho!” exclaimed Mabel, whose
heart beat high with excitement and pleasure, which
was only heightened by a slight touch of feminine
fear.</p>

<p>Whether it were the effect of her words, or of the
somewhat rocking motion given to the car, even
while resting on the grass, by the swaying of the
huge ball above it,—or whether the wine too hastily
taken had risen into the brain of the earl, was a
point never clearly decided; but at this moment the
nervousness of Dashleigh suddenly rose to a pitch
which entirely mastered his judgment. Rising from
his seat with an agitated air, he attempted to push
past Augustine, in order to get out of the car. His
friend, extremely annoyed at the thought of so public
an exhibition of weakness, laid his hand on the arm
of the earl; but this slight action seemed only to
rouse the miserable man to frenzy.</p>

<p>“Let go!” exclaimed Dashleigh, in a voice so loud
that it resounded to the utmost edges of the crowd;
“Let go!” echoed a thousand voices, believing it to
be the signal for ascent! The men who were grasping
the ropes instantly obeyed the word, and almost
with the sudden effect of an explosion, the immense
balloon darted upwards to the sky, shrinking before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
the upturned eyes of the breathless spectators, till
its vast globe gradually dwindled to the apparent
size of the plaything of a child!</p>

<p>There were deafening cheers from the crowd
beyond the hedge; “Bravo! bravo! off she goes!”
shouted stentorian voices; but on the faces of the
nearest spectators were painted fear and dismay, as
Mr. Verdon—interrupted in the midst of hurried
directions by the sudden cry and shout, stretched
out his hands wildly towards the receding balloon,
and exclaimed in a tone of anguish,—“Merciful
Heaven! they are lost!”</p>

<p>“Lost! what do you mean, man?” exclaimed
Bardon, coming forward in his blunt manner to give
a voice to the fears of the rest. “And how does it
happen that you are not in the car?”</p>

<p>“The signal was given too soon!” cried Verdon,
his nervous accents betraying his emotion. “I was
just questioning my assistant as to the working of
the valve, for I thought that something seemed
wrong with the rope, when a voice shouted out,
‘Let go!’ and the idiots took that for the signal.”</p>

<p>“But you do not apprehend danger?” cried a
gentleman near.</p>

<p>“Danger!” repeated Verdon impatiently; “why,
Aumerle knows no more of the management of a
balloon than a child;—Heaven only knows if we
shall ever look on their faces again!”</p>

<p>Terror, wonder, compassion, now spread rapidly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
through the assembled throng; lip after lip repeating
the tale with its own comments and exaggerations.
Exclamations of pity and grief resounded on all
sides, as straining eyes attempted to pierce the cloud
which soon hid the <i>Eaglet</i> from view. Once it was
visible for a few minutes, and little dim specks
could be distinguished in the car, which were known
to be the living human beings who had so lately
been standing in health and strength on that very
spot! It was a sickening reflection that they were
now utterly beyond reach of man’s aid, drifting
away at the mercy of the winds, perhaps to some
terrible fate which might be guessed at, but never
known. None, perhaps, felt the revulsion more
terribly than Timon Bardon. He who had exulted
in revenge, found the cup which he had grasped
so eagerly, and deemed so sweet, suddenly changed
to a burning poison. His fierce, strong nature made
his sense of suffering peculiarly acute. “How shall
I tell this to Annabella?” was the distracting thought
uppermost in his mind, as throwing himself on a
horse which had been lent to him for the occasion,
he dashed wildly along the road which led to his
little home.</p>

<p>“Oh, how delightful!” was the first exclamation of
Mabel, as the <i>Eaglet</i> shot upwards, swiftly, but
with a motion so smooth that its speed was only
made known by the earth and the spectators appearing
to sink down—down—ever growing less and less,
while the cheers sounded fainter and fainter, as
rising up from a distance. “How delightful!” she
repeated, waving a little flag as her farewell to those
below.</p>

<p>But when the smiling Mabel turned to look at
her companions, she was somewhat startled to mark
that the countenance of her uncle was of the same
ashen hue as that of the earl.</p>

<p>“How is it that Mr. Verdon is not with us?”
exclaimed Mabel in some surprise.</p>

<p>Augustine silenced her by a warning look. His
grasp on the arm of Dashleigh had grown heavier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
and tighter; but for that grasp it is possible that the
nobleman, in the first excitement of fear, would
have flung himself out of the car. Augustine’s first
thought was for his companion, for he felt that the
unhappy Dashleigh was trembling convulsively under
his hand.</p>

<p>“Well, my friends,” said he, in a tone so cheerful
that it completely deceived his niece; “Verdon will
think it a shame if we do not go back for him
directly; I propose, therefore, that we descend.”</p>

<p>“Yes, descend!” cried Dashleigh wildly; and a
strange faint echo from the far earth repeated the
word, “Descend!”</p>

<p>Augustine was almost afraid to loosen his hold
on the arm of the earl; it was, however, necessary
that he should try some means of bringing the
<i>Eaglet</i> to the ground. He was, of course, aware
that this means must be to let out the gas which inflated
the ball, but ignorant as he was of the practical
working of a balloon, however easily he might grasp
its theory, Augustine was left to guess the way in
which this effect might be produced. Mabel, who
had perfect confidence in the power of her gifted
uncle to master any difficulty, and who saw no
change in his countenance except the paleness which
overspread his handsome features, had no idea of the
anxious fear which now perplexed his mind.</p>

<p>Augustine laid hold of a rope which seemed to
him to be the one most probably attached to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
valve at the top of the ball, and in this his reason
had not misled him. The valve was constructed to
open inwardly, so that the pressure of the gas within
might keep it constantly closed, except when mechanical
means were applied to counteract that
pressure. But Mr. Verdon’s misgiving had not been
without foundation; there was some hitch with the
valve which prevented its working properly under
an inexperienced hand. As Augustine pulled the
rope, the balloon entered into a cloud, and the travellers
suddenly found themselves enveloped in a
dense, damp, chilly mist.</p>

<p>“Are we ascending or descending?” asked Mabel,
“for the balloon is so steady that it does not seem
to be moving at all.”</p>

<p>Her uncle, who, with far greater anxiety, had
been asking himself the same question, replied in a
voice still perfectly calm, “throw down some pieces
of paper, and we shall ascertain that fact directly.”</p>

<p>Wondering that he should not know it without
having recourse to experiment, Mabel immediately
obeyed. “The bits seem to fall, not like paper, but
like lead!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Then we must be ascending rapidly still,”
muttered Augustine; and he pulled the rope with
such desperate force that it snapped in his hand, and
all communication with the all-important valve was
broken off for ever.</p>

<p>“God have mercy upon us!” was Augustine’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
instinctive prayer, not uttered aloud from the fear of
alarming his companions. The thick mist prevented
Mabel from having any clear idea of what her uncle
was doing, but she thought him strangely silent, and
a damping chill came over her young spirit like the
fog which enwrapped her form. Augustine looked
up almost in despair at the huge indistinct mass
looming as a dark cloud above him. Oh! that there
were but any means of tearing open a passage for the
gas! The wicker car, suspended by ropes, hung too
low beneath the ball for it to be possible for
Aumerle’s extended arm to reach the silken globe,
or his penknife would have at once offered an easy
solution of the difficulty. A light, agile sea-boy
might possibly have climbed one of the ropes, and
so have reached the inflated ball; but the brain of
Augustine turned dizzy at the very thought of
attempting to clamber at the awful height to which
he knew that he must now have attained. His
frame was remarkable for strength as well as for
manly beauty, but was altogether unfitted for a
perilous feat like this. To have attempted it must
have been inevitably to fall and perish.</p>

<p>Suddenly, to Mabel’s relief, the balloon emerged
from its misty shroud, and burst again into the
brightness of day. The scene was one never to be
forgotten, but Mabel was the only one of the travellers
whose mind was sufficiently at ease to enjoy
its sublime and awful beauty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>Above was the sky—deeply, intensely blue, such
as in Italy meets the enchanted gaze. Below was a
floor of pure white cloud, spread out, as it appeared
to Mabel, like a vast sea of cotton, on which lay
piled here and there vast masses, or islands of snow.
Some of these masses were floating beneath them
with a slow and majestic motion, impelled by currents
of wind which did not reach the strata of air
to which the balloon had ascended. Presently the
white floor seemed gradually to part on either side,
and an opening appeared through which a strange
panoramic view of the earth burst on the wondering
eye. It lay—Oh! how far beneath! There was no
distinction of mountain or plain, a dim blue hue
tinted all. In the words of a former æronaut,—“The
whole appeared a perfect plain, the highest
building having no apparent height, but reduced all
to the same level, and the whole terrestrial prospect
seemed like a coloured map.” There lay Dashleigh
Hall, the seat of ancestral pride, shrunk to the appearance
of a tiny toy,—a mere nothing viewed
from that awful height, even as all earth’s pomps
and grandeur must appear to those who survey them
from heaven. For the first time since he had worn
his honours, Dashleigh felt them no cause for pride.
He was in his own eyes no peer, no lofty aristocrat,
but a poor, weak child of man, with every nerve unstrung,
and an undefined horror hanging over him.
Gladly would he then have exchanged places with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
the poorest peasant standing on solid ground, though
not possessing a single foot of it.</p>

<p>“Look upwards—upwards—not downwards!”
cried Augustine, alarmed at the wild expression on
the haggard face of his friend. “Lie down, Dashleigh,
at the bottom of the car, and fix your gaze on
the sky above!”</p>

<p>“Uncle!” exclaimed Mabel, “how strange your
voice sounds—like what one might hear in a dream;
and my own, too, seems quite different from what it
was when we were on the ground.”</p>

<p>“This is the effect of the rarified air upon the
ear.”</p>

<p>“Uncle, the objects below us grow smaller and
smaller, we must be rising higher and higher; I
thought that you meant to descend.”</p>

<p>Augustine’s only reply was a look which in an
instant, as by a lightning flash, revealed to the
young girl the full danger of their situation.</p>

<p>“You cannot descend!” she gasped forth, clasping
her hands in terror.</p>

<p>“Remember <em>him</em>,” said Augustine in a very low
voice; “if he knew our helpless condition, I believe
that it would turn his brain.”</p>

<p>“But cannot you tell how to let out the gas?”</p>

<p>“I cannot—”</p>

<p>“You who know everything—”</p>

<p>“I do not know this.”</p>

<p>Mabel sank back upon the seat from which she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
had half risen while addressing her uncle, who,
holding firmly by a rope, was standing upright in
the car. She was a brave girl, and acted as such;
she neither uttered cry nor shed tear, but she turned
very pale and cold, and shivered as if mantled in ice.
It gave her now a sickening oppression to gaze
below. Was she never, never to return to that
earth which lay beneath her—never again to be
pressed to her father’s heart—never to meet the
smile of her sister! Was she to float on in these
dreary regions never before visited by man, buoyed
up in a moving coffin, till—</p>

<p>The awful, deathlike stillness was suddenly broken
by a sharp report, sounding to the startled ears of
the travellers something like that of a pistol! It
was but a cork in the refreshment basket going off
from the diminished pressure of the atmosphere
causing the wine in the bottle to expand, but the
explosion of a cannon could hardly have produced a
more startling effect than a noise so sudden and so
unexpected. Dashleigh sprang like a maniac from
the bottom of the car, in which he had been quietly
lying, and made a frantic attempt to throw himself
out of the car. Augustine had to struggle and
wrestle to keep him down, as one engaged in a contest
for life; and the <i>Eaglet</i>, at the same time,
passing into a violent current of air, rocked and
shook, and swung to such an extent, that Mabel had
to grasp tight hold of the wicker-work to prevent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
herself from being flung down into the clouds which
again had closed beneath them.</p>

<p>The whirlwind grew yet more tremendous, tossing
to and fro the enormous balloon as if it had been a
bubble on the current, actually turning it round and
round, and making the car describe a wide swinging
circuit below it.</p>

<p>It was a very awful moment—a moment in which
the heart almost ceases to beat, and the only utterance
of the soul can be a cry to the God that made
it! It seemed as in answer to that instinctive
prayer to the ear that is never closed, that the
whirlwind soon appeared to lessen its violence, the
motion of the balloon abated, the frightful swinging
of the car ceased, and Augustine uttered a faint
“thank God!” while Dashleigh sank senseless at
his feet!</p>

<p>The mind of Ida was not quite satisfied that it was
right in her sister to ascend in the <i>Eaglet</i>, contrary
to the direct and positive prohibition of her step-mother.
Ida could not help suspecting that she herself
had not proved altogether a safe guide for her
younger sister; she feared that while discouraging
the expedition on the plea of danger, she had not
sufficiently done so on the score of duty. The more
Ida reflected on the subject, the more conscience reproached
her for rather nurturing than repressing the
spirit of independence which proudly rose against
the control of Mrs. Aumerle, both in Mabel’s heart
and her own.</p>

<p>Ida was not one to deaden conscience by refusing
to listen to its voice, and she arose on the morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
of the 12th resolved to use her strongest persuasions
to induce Mabel to give up her project. She went
to the room of her sister, but found it already empty;
and then proceeded to the garden, but Mabel had
left it some minutes before.</p>

<p>Ida felt that it was too late for her to undo any
mischief which might have been done, and made no
mention at the breakfast table of Mabel’s intention
to ascend, not wishing to be the first to draw upon
her sister the displeasure of Mrs. Aumerle.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” thought Ida, “reflection has had the
same effect upon Mabel that it has had upon myself;
she may have come to the like conclusion that it
would be wrong to go in the car. I earnestly hope
that it may be so, for I feel a strange uneasiness at
the thought of her venturing aloft. Yet there can
be no real danger, or my uncle would never have
wished to take Mabel with him, nor my dear father
have half consented to her going up in the balloon.
If she only come back in safety I shall feel a weight
taken off my heart, and I shall in future more earnestly
try to lead her aright in all things.”</p>

<p>About the hour of noon, as the vicar was writing
in his study, he was interrupted by the entrance of
Ida.</p>

<p>“Dearest Papa,” said she, gently approaching him,
and seating herself at his feet, “forgive me for disturbing
you when you are busy, but I want your
permission to go and see Annabella again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>The vicar looked grave, but made no reply.</p>

<p>“When I last went to Mill Cottage with Mabel,
and our cousin refused to see us, you said that it was
your desire that we should leave her to herself for
the present; but it is to-day, as you know, that her
husband is to go up in the <i>Eaglet</i>, and I cannot help
imagining how anxious and unhappy Annabella must
be, because—”</p>

<p>“Because she has goaded him to the step,” said
the vicar.</p>

<p>“Somehow I am so restless to-day—I can neither
read nor work,—and my heart draws me towards
Annabella. I fancy—it may be presumption, but I
fancy that her spirit may be softened just now, and
that some word might be spoken which might make
it more easy to reconcile her to her husband. Have
I your consent to my going?”</p>

<p>“I will go with you, my child,” said the vicar
putting up his papers and locking his desk. “I believe
that anything that we may say to that poor
misguided girl will be likely to have more effect
during the absence of Dr. Bardon. Whatever may
be the cause for his dislike, it is evident that he
nourishes a strong prejudice against the Earl of
Dashleigh.”</p>

<p>It was not long before the father and daughter,
bound on their errand of love, reached the cottage
in which the countess had chosen to take up her
abode. They were ushered into the sitting-room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
where they found Cecilia bending pensively over a
piece of embroidery, and the countess with a book in
her hand, which she had, however, only taken up as
a device for silencing conversation, as during the last
half-hour she had not turned over a leaf.</p>

<p>Miss Bardon welcomed her guests with smiles;
Annabella with a stiff politeness, which said as distinctly
as manner could convey meaning, “There must
be no entering upon any disagreeable subject of conversation;
the parson must not preach, nor the friend
attempt to persuade.”</p>

<p>Ida’s heart yearned over her cousin, but she had
not courage to break through that formidable barrier
of reserve. The vicar saw that the first sentence
bordering upon reproof would be the signal for his
niece to quit the apartment. Disappointed, but not
yet disheartened, the good man inwardly prayed that
He who can alone order the unruly wills and affections
of his sinful creatures, would bend the proud
spirit of the haughty girl, and open her eyes to her
error. Little did he dream of the manner in which
that prayer would be answered!</p>

<p>As might be imagined, under the circumstances the
conversation was constrained; Miss Bardon principally
sustained it, for she was the only one present
who could talk at ease on all the trifling topics of
the day.</p>

<p>“Hark!” exclaimed Cecilia suddenly, “there is a
horse running away!” and her words seemed confirmed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
by so rapid a clatter of hoofs, that not only
Ida, but Aumerle and the countess followed her
quickly to the open door to see if some rider were
not in peril.</p>

<p>The alarm was in one sense a false one; the horse
that came gallopping on was impelled to furious speed
by the whip and the spur of its rider, as if—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Headlong haste or deadly fear</div>
<div class="verse">Urged the precipitate career;”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>and the party saw with surprise that this rider was
Dr. Bardon. He reined up so suddenly at the garden-gate
that the panting steed was thrown violently
back on its haunches. The doctor flung himself
quickly from the saddle, and without even pausing
to throw the rein round a post, advanced to the party
at the door. His long white hair streamed wildly
back from his excited face.</p>

<p>“Something has happened!” exclaimed Ida; Annabella’s
tongue seemed to cleave to the roof of her
mouth!</p>

<p>“The balloon!” cried Cecilia; “tell us, oh! tell us,
has some accident befallen the balloon?”</p>

<p>The gesture of Bardon was one which might well
have beseemed a prophet of desolation, as raising his
arm he exclaimed, “Lost! lost! past recovery!”</p>

<p>“How lost?—what would you have us believe?—remember
in whose presence you speak!” cried Lawrence
Aumerle almost sternly.</p>

<p>“I cannot mince my tale,” was the gloomy reply,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
“nor deal out poison by drops. By some fatal mistake
the balloon was let off before the car had been
entered by the only man who could guide it. We
are never likely to hear anything more of it, or the
unfortunate beings within it!”</p>

<p>“Who were in it?” exclaimed the Aumerles in one
breath. “Who were in it?” echoed the countess in a
sepulchral voice, fixing upon Bardon an eye which
sought to read in his face a sentence of life or death.</p>

<p>“Augustine Aumerle was there—and Mabel—”</p>

<p>The father uttered an exclamation of anguish, and
Ida staggered backwards, closing her eyes, as if a
poniard had stuck her.</p>

<p>“And—and—the Earl of Dashleigh!”</p>

<p>Annabella gave such a piercing cry as agony might
wring from a wretch upon the rack, and would have
sunk on the earth but for the support of her uncle.</p>

<p>“There may be hope yet,—God is merciful,—He
will have compassion on us,—let us pray, let us pray!”
exclaimed the vicar, in the sight of the misery of
another seeming half to forget his own.</p>

<p>“See—see!” exclaimed Cecilia, suddenly pointing
towards the sky.</p>

<p>There was breathless silence in a moment, and
every eye was eagerly turned in the same direction.
A small dark object appeared aloft, floating far, far
higher than wing of bird ever could soar! Who
can describe the intensity of the agonizing gaze fixed
by father—sister—wife, upon that little distant ball?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
Arms were wildly stretched towards it, but not a
word was uttered, scarce a breath was drawn while
it yet remained in sight. Even when it had disappeared,
the upwards-gazing group seemed almost
as if transfixed into stone; till Bardon, with rough
kindness, attempted to draw Annabella back into the
cottage, muttering, “I feel for you, from my soul I
do!”</p>

<p>“Feel for me!” exclaimed the countess, shrinking
from his touch with an expression of horror, her pent-up
anguish finding vent in passionate upbraiding;
“you who led me to this abyss of misery, you who
roused up my accursed pride, you who made me write
words which I would now only too gladly blot out
with my heart’s blood! But for you I might have
listened to truth; but for you I might never have left
the true friends to whom I turn in my agony now!
Oh, may God forgive you,” she added wildly,—“God
help me to forgive you, but never, never enter my
presence—never let me behold you again!”</p>

<p>And so they parted, the tempter and the tempted—the
countess to return to the vicarage with her almost
heart-broken companions, Dr. Bardon to brood
in his solitary cottage over deep, unavailing regrets!</p>

<p>In the dark abode of endless woe thus may bitter
recrimination deepen the anguish of the lost, when
some wretched soul recognises the author of his misery
in one called on earth his friend, who had stirred up
his evil passions, and pampered his fatal pride!</p>

<p>The great red sun, like a huge globe of fire, was sinking
in the west,—I would have said the horizon, but
that word gives the idea of a point nearly level with
the eye, while the orb appeared far beneath them to
the travellers in the <i>Eaglet</i>. The red light tinted
with a fiery glow the lower hemisphere of the balloon,
which was all that met the eye of the earl, for he
had cautiously abstained for many hours from glancing
downwards towards the earth.</p>

<p>Dashleigh was now perfectly calm, though silent
and thoughtful. That one fearful day had effected
upon the young nobleman the work of years. Deeply
solemn were his reflections. With a conscience
neither dead nor unenlightened, the earl had needed
no prophet to decipher for him the fiery “letters on
the wall” of affliction. Heavily and yet more heavily
had descended on him the Almighty’s chastening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
hand, and every blow had evidently been aimed at
his pride! Had he not been humiliated in the
presence of his friend,—satirized by his wife, ridiculed
by the world, and had he not now by an unconquerable
weakness, which a girl would have blushed to
betray, been the actual cause of the fearful position
in which he and his companions appeared! Bitter,
bitter was the humiliation of the proud man! Had
he been destitute of the faith which supports, and
the hope which cheers, Dashleigh would have been
utterly crushed by the successive strokes laid upon him.
But in him there was much of the gold, which beneath
the hammer “does not break, but extend.” Dashleigh
resembled less the son of Kish whom trial drove
into fierce despair, than the haughty Assyrian king
who, having endured that most humbling degradation
which was the appointed punishment for pride,
“lifted up” his “eyes unto heaven,” and “blessed
the most High,” with a spirit subdued.</p>

<p>Strangely had passed the day; as light as the
feather down, the balloon floated in the ocean of air.
The party in the car had partaken of the slight refreshment
which had been provided, in little expectation
that even that would be required during a two
hours’ expedition. Beverage there was none, for the
wine had exploded both the bottles from the cause
mentioned in a preceding chapter. The lips of each
of the sufferers was parched and dry, and a painful
sensation of thirst was added to the trials of the hour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>Augustine and Mabel had exhausted all their inventive
powers in contriving means to cut an opening
in the ball of the balloon. Several attempts had
been made, but all had ended in disappointment.
The knife, flung upwards with a steady hand, had
glanced back from the varnished silk, and fallen
through depths which the mind shuddered to calculate.
Every effort but strengthened the conviction
that all effort was unavailing.</p>

<p>There had been silence for a long time in the car,—silence
of which dwellers upon earth can scarcely
form a conception. There was here no rustling leaf,
no buzz of an insect’s wing to break the awful stillness!
Motion itself was impalpable, being unaccompanied
by the slightest sound!</p>

<p>“Augustine,” said the earl, raising himself on his
elbow, for he still in a reclining posture occupied the
lower part of the car, “do you believe that you can
hide from me the fact that you have no power over
the balloon; that our condition is hopeless?”</p>

<p>“Nay,” replied his friend, “let us never despair.
The gas may yet find some vent. There was never
yet balloon made so air-tight that it would not leak
in the course of time.”</p>

<p>Mabel thought that she had never seen the pale,
delicate features of the earl invested with such true
dignity, as when with low, but distinct utterance he
made his reply: “I would rather look the danger
in the face. My brain is not dizzy now,—none are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
dizzy who look above rather than below them. I
have a presentiment that we shall never reach the
ground alive.”</p>

<p>Not a word was uttered in contradiction or reply,
and the earl continued in the same calm, deliberate
tone: “Death is a great preacher, Augustine; he
tells us startling truths! He tarnishes with a touch
the gilding on objects that once appeared to us
bright! He levels the prince and the peasant. He
has been preaching to me a soul-searching sermon,
and from a very solemn text.”</p>

<p>“What is the text?” inquired Augustine, while
Mabel bent forward to listen.</p>

<p>“<em>The loftiness of man shall be bowed down and
the haughtiness of man shall be laid low, and the
Lord alone shall be exalted in that day.</em>”</p>

<p>Again there was solemn, deathlike silence! Perhaps,
as Mabel and her uncle sat watching the last
edge of the sun’s disc disappear, and the sky gradually
darken into night, the self-reliant genius, the
high-spirited girl, were secretly applying to themselves
the sublime words of the prophet of Judah.</p>

<p>While twilight still lingered, a thought struck
Mabel. She remembered that she had brought with
her an envelope ready directed to her sister, with a
sheet of blank paper enclosed, for her fancy had been
pleased with the idea of dating a letter from “the
clouds.” Making a table of her seat in the car,
Mabel knelt down, and with a pencil wrote a sad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
and touching farewell to the parent and sister so
tenderly loved. Many names were kindly remembered
in that note, for the proud spirit of Mabel was
softened and subdued by the pressure of trial, and
no one was then recalled to her mind but with a
feeling of kindness. To her step-mother Mabel sent
a long message. She confessed her fault with frank
regret, and asked the pardon of Mrs. Aumerle, not
only for the last act of open disobedience which was
now so fearfully punished, but for a long course of
petty provocations, for sullen looks, and proud retorts,
and bitter words spoken against her; Mabel entreated
forgiveness for all. Her tears dropped fast upon
the sheet—the first tears which she had shed on
that day, but she dashed them hastily from her eyes.
Mabel then folded the note and kissed it, as if
believing that the paper might bear to her home
the impress of that last token of love; then she
dropped her letter over the side of the car, watching
it as it descended, and picturing to herself the grief
and tenderness with which it would be received, and
read, and treasured up as a mournful memorial of
her of whose fate it might be the only record.</p>

<p>Dashleigh had watched the action of his young
companion, and now drew from his vest a small but
very elegant pocket-book, which bore on one side an
embossed gold shield, on which his name was engraved,
surmounted by his coronet. This was the
first gift of affection which the young nobleman had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
received from his affianced bride. It had been his
constant companion since the hour when he had
received it from her hand. Dashleigh opened the
book, and gazed for some moments on the inscription
written on the fly-leaf, though the thickening darkness
would have rendered it difficult to decipher, had
he not known every syllable by heart. The earl
then, rather by feeling than sight, traced two words
on one of the blank pages, reclasped the book, and
gave it to Mabel with an expressive movement of
the hand. Sadly and silently she dropped into the
dark abyss the love token of the unhappy Annabella.</p>

<p>More than an hour elapsed before the silence
again was broken. The thin air of these upper
regions had become intensely cold, and Mabel shivered
in her spring attire. The balloon was drifting
steadily on before the night breeze, as was marked
by its dark globe appearing to blot out one constellation
after another from the sky as it swept on,
the sole object that broke the immense expanse of
the star-lit heavens.</p>

<p>“I think,” observed Mabel with a heavy sigh,
“that all in my father’s house must now be met
together for evening prayers.” She paused, as fancy
brought before her eye the warm lighted room, the
curtains drawn, the lamp-light falling on so many
dear familiar faces! Mabel thought how her father’s
voice would tremble as he uttered his fervent supplications<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
for those in such awful peril, and how Ida
would try to smother her bursting sobs, that she
might not unnerve him by the sound of her distress.
“They will be praying for us,” continued Mabel;
“should we not pray together—even here?”</p>

<p>“None have more need of prayer,” murmured the
earl; Augustine’s head was bowed in assent.</p>

<p>“God is with us—even in this awful, awful
height where no human being can approach us,”
faltered Mabel.</p>

<p>“Augustine Aumerle,” said Lord Dashleigh, “do
you lead our evening devotion.”</p>

<p>“Any one rather than me!” exclaimed Augustine;
“none so unfit—so unworthy—so incapable!”</p>

<p>And there was truth in these strange words. To
the gifted scholar, the eloquent orator, the language
of prayer was not familiar, the spirit of prayer had
long, alas! been unknown! Augustine had indeed,
during his visit to his brother, usually joined in the
family devotions, but he had done so from courtesy
to man, not from reverence for God. Unconvinced
of the weakness or sinfulness of his own nature, he
had sought neither pardon nor aid; he had felt no
need of a divine sustaining power, for he had contentedly
rested on his own. Augustine had made
an idol of Intellect, with Pride for its priest, under
the much abused name of Reason. What marvel
that with all his knowledge Augustine knew not
how to pray!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>The earl felt the difficulty almost as strongly as
his friend, though from a different cause. He had
never been disturbed by a doubt on the subject of
religion, and had from his earliest youth regarded
revealed truth with reverence, and acts of worship
with respect; but he had carried even into his
devotion the cold formality which naturally followed
an overweening sense of personal dignity. Dashleigh
had been a regular attendant at church; but with
the shy reserve of his nature, it would have seemed
to him, till that night, impossible to have poured
forth in the hearing of man an extempore prayer to
his God. But where Pride is humbled, the spirit of
supplication may rest. Never had the peer so felt
before the littleness of personal distinctions; never,
therefore, before had his heart been so attuned to
simple prayer. As Augustine shrank from leading
the devotions, which each one present felt would be
at once the source of comfort and the fulfilment of
duty, the nobleman, with folded hands, repeated
aloud the first petitions in the Litany which instinct
rather than memory suggested to his mind. Augustine
and his young niece in low and earnest tones
echoed the cry for mercy upon miserable sinners;
and when it was followed by the comprehensive
prayer, “in all time of our tribulation, in all time
of our wealth, in the hour of death, and in the day
of judgment—<em>Lord, deliver us!</em>” arose in solemn
unison from three voices and three hearts. Never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
had the supplication been more earnestly, more fervently
breathed.</p>

<p>The Lord’s Prayer concluded the brief service,
which for the time made that little car appear as a
floating temple. The chill cloudy solitude seemed
less terrible when the name of the Giver of all good,
the Fount of all blessings, had sounded within it.
Those who had prayed together, felt their souls more
knit together, and more prepared to meet with firmness
whatever the dark, drear night might bring.
Philosophy had brought no comfort, earthly rank
no relief, but the sense of the presence of a heavenly
Father was as balm to the suffering sinking soul.</p>

<p>The grief of Annabella and of Ida partook of the
nature of their several characters; one was violent
and passionate, the other quiet and deep. In the
strong revulsion of feeling and anguish of remorse,
the countess could scarcely remember a fault in him
whom she had lately stigmatised as tyrannical, and
satirized as weak. The earl’s tragical fate seemed
to throw a halo around him, and his wife remembered
him but as the tender wooer, the affectionate husband,
the dignified, yet courteous nobleman, graceful
in person, lofty in principle—who had sought and
won the heart of a girl whose pride, petulance, and
passion, had destroyed the man whom she loved!
Annabella tore her beautiful hair, and struck her
bosom, as if she would have wreaked vengeance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
on herself for the fearful ruin that her folly had
wrought!</p>

<p>Ida found that her presence could afford no consolation
to her cousin; and then, not till then, she
hastened up to Mabel’s little room, now again to
become her own, and falling on her knees by the
bedside, buried her face in her hands, and poured
forth an agonized prayer. She remained long in the
same position, and then arose trembling and pale.
Every object in the room seemed to awaken a fresh
burst of sorrow. There was Ida’s own likeness on
the wall, sketched by the hand of Mabel,—a rough,
unfinished drawing, indeed, but yet a labour of love.
There were fragrant lilac blossoms from the favourite
bush which Mabel always called her “Ida,” and
there on the toilette table lay a small Bible, Mabel’s
birthday gift from her sister, where many a mark
and double mark showed that it had at least been
perused with interest and attention. This Bible
now afforded the most soothing consolation to the
aching heart of Ida.</p>

<p>Mrs. Aumerle had been far more astonished than
pleased at the unexpected return of the countess,
until she learned its sad cause. Her feelings then
became of a very mingled nature. The danger of
the party in the balloon, and the grief of those left
behind, excited her heartfelt pity; but her soul
vibrated between that emotion, and indignation at
the conduct which had occasioned the tragic event.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
When the lady thought of the countess’s pride, or
the wilful disobedience of Mabel, she could not shut
out from her mind the reflection that they had
brought all their trouble upon themselves. Mrs.
Aumerle’s predominating sensation, however, was
sympathy with her afflicted husband, and she did
everything that lay in her power to inspire him
with the cheering hopes that were strong within her
own bosom.</p>

<p>“Nay, Lawrence, give not way to despair; this
agrees neither with reason nor religion. Depend
upon it everything will turn out far better than you
could expect. The balloon will come down quietly
to earth as other balloons have done, and we shall
have the whole party sitting here—perhaps to-morrow,
talking over their adventures, and smiling
at our alarm. Don’t tell me that your brother
knows nothing about guiding a balloon—he is so
wonderfully clever that he knows everything by
intuition. He will find some method of getting
safely out of the difficulty; my mind always grows
easier when I think what a genius he is!”</p>

<p>Aumerle was walking up and down in his study,
as if motion could relieve his mental distress, at each
turn pausing at the window to look anxiously out
upon the sky. He stopped short as his wife concluded
her last sentence, and murmured, “My poor,
poor brother! the bitterest trial of all is the fear
that he is unprepared for the awful change!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>“This very trial may be sent to prepare him for
it, to make him think more than he has ever yet
done of the one thing that is needful. And our poor
wilful Mabel—”</p>

<p>“Oh! blame not her—blame not her!” exclaimed
Ida, who had entered as Mrs. Aumerle was speaking,
and who now bent at her stepmother’s feet in a
posture of humiliation as well as of grief; “you and
my dear father must learn how much of her fault
rests with me. It is a bitter confession, but I can
find no peace till it is made. Dear Mabel came to
me yesterday evening, and told me that Papa had
given a kind of permission to her to ascend in the
<i>Eaglet</i>, bidding her at the same time consult you—”</p>

<p>“I positively forbade her,” interrupted the lady.</p>

<p>“I know it—she told me all—and had I done
my duty,” continued Ida, her voice hardly articulate
through sobs, “I would have told her that your
refusal was sufficient—that she should submit and
obey. But somehow—I can scarcely recall in what
way—a chord of pride was touched in my own
sinful heart; I felt it difficult to urge on her a duty
which I had so often neglected myself, and I can
now scarcely hope for my father’s forgiveness, or
yours, or my own—”</p>

<p>The last words were sobbed forth on the bosom
of Mrs. Aumerle, for Ida’s lowly confession had
made her step-mother forget everything but the
sister’s grief and repentance, and no parent could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
more kindly have strained to her heart a beloved
and penitent child, than the hard, severe, practical
Barbara Aumerle embraced the daughter of her husband.
Her tones were those of maternal tenderness
and sympathy for the sorrower as she said, “Don’t
reproach yourself, darling,—don’t reproach yourself, I
believe there were faults on both sides!”</p>

<p>The vicar, with moist eyes and a thankful heart,
saw for the first time cordial sympathy between two
beings whom he dearly loved; and Pride fled in
gloomy disappointment from the scene, for he knew
that the chain of his captive was broken!</p>

<p>It is the darkest hour of night, that hour which
precedes the dawn. A thousand stars are spangling
the deep azure of the sky, looking down, like angels’
eyes, on a world of sin and sorrow. Augustine’s
gaze is fixed upon one beauteous planet, which, in
its calm light, outshines the tremulous glory of the
constellations. Mabel has wearily fallen asleep
where she sits, resting her head on her arm, the
piercing cold of the upper air making her slumber
the deeper. The earl, still stretched at the bottom
of the car, is also finding a short oblivion of woe,
and in dreams is wandering again upon the warm,
bright, joyous earth, with Annabella at his side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>Augustine, on his dizzy height, in the stillness of
the hour, feels himself alone with his God. The
conversation held at the vicarage with his brother
now recurs to his mind with a deep and solemn
effect. Augustine draws a mental parallel between
his own present awful position and that in which
his soul has for so long unfearingly remained. Has
he not been, as it were, floating between earth and
heaven, carried up by his pride, full inflated as that
swollen ball which is at this moment bearing him
onward perhaps to destruction! Has he any reason
to rejoice that he has risen high above the mass of
his fellow-creatures, if his very exaltation prove the
means of his deeper fall!</p>

<p>“Yes, fool that I was! I believed my intellect
formed to pierce through the mists, to rise above the
clouds, to find for itself a path that no mortal had
discovered before! With proud presumption I
refused the guidance of Faith in those regions to
which Faith alone has access. I trusted to reason—philosophy—genius!—what
have they done for
me here? I have proved unequal even to the task
of regulating the motions of this silken machine, yet
I feared not to steer my own way through the vast
mysteries of spiritual knowledge! As regards the
soul as well as its mortal tenement, I have been the
sport of the changing winds, enwrapt in the seething
mist, struggling on through thickening darkness—and
to what point now have I reached? I see the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
calm, still stars above me, shining like the eternal
truths which audacious Pride once dared to question;
I view the orbs which for ages unnumbered have
kept their steady course through infinite space,
upheld by the Power and Wisdom whose mysteries
I vainly sought to fathom; earth’s lights have all
faded and gone, the brightest illumine no more, the
clearest throw no ray on this darkness,—the gems
of the firmament alone, unchanged and unapproachable
by man, are glittering over me still!</p>

<p>“Yes, I feel myself an atom in the vast universe
which is filled by God! And yet man’s moral
responsibility—the awful trust of an immortal, an
accountable soul—give a fearful dignity to him still!
Am I fit to appear in the presence of Him before
whose throne I so soon may stand? Is there anything
in myself to which I can cling for support in
the day of judgment? Can I plead my merits—my
virtues—my works? No; the truth is forced upon
me here, which mortal presumption so long refused
to acknowledge. As well might I fling myself from
this car, and falling a thousand fathoms hope to
reach the earth uninjured, as trust to find safety for
a guilty and sentenced soul without the one sacrifice
for sin, the atonement provided for those who with
child-like faith rest upon it, and it only!”</p>

<p>As Augustine pursued his solemn meditations,
gradually the stars became dimmer at the approach
of the dawn, even as the heavenly lights vouchsafed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
to guide us here, will pale in the radiance of a more
perfect knowledge of a more glorious day; the deep
blue sky assumed a somewhat lighter hue, and the
looming outline of the balloon was seen more distinctly
against it.</p>

<p>“Do my eyes deceive me,” thought Augustine,
“or is the curve of that outline less bold than it
appeared in the light of the setting sun? It may
be but fancy, but it seems as though the ball were
less fully inflated; I could imagine that I even perceive
what resembles a wrinkle in the silk. God in
mercy grant that this new hope be not an illusion!”
As he spoke, something like the smoke-wreath from
the mouth of a discharged cannon floated upwards
not far from the car, then another and another, all
ascending lightly from beneath, and mounting high
above the balloon.</p>

<p>“The clouds appear to rise!” exclaimed Augustine
eagerly; “a sure sign that we ourselves are descending!”
He started from his seat, and grasping a
rope, looked over into the abyss.</p>

<p>The dim grey twilight scarcely yet sufficed to show
objects distinctly, though not a single cloud now
obscured the wide spreading prospect below. Augustine
strained his eyes with gazing for several
minutes before he became fully assured of the nature
of what lay beneath him. One long faint streak of
red at length clearly defined the line where the sky
met the rounded horizon; there was no object, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
the smallest, to break that hard sharp line which
separated misty blue from deepening crimson; nor
swelling hill, nor rising mountain was there; Augustine’s
pulse beat quicker and he gasped as for breath,
for he was now convinced of two facts, each of
thrilling importance,—that the <i>Eaglet</i> was quickly
descending, and that it was descending into the
sea!</p>

<p>“The breeze must have borne us above the
Channel, and may bear us across it, if for but one
or two hours we can keep the balloon aloft! But
the gas is evidently fast escaping, and unless I
lighten the car, we shall soon be precipitated into
the wide waste of waters beneath!”</p>

<p>With almost the rapidity of thought, Augustine
caught up the large bag of ballast and flung it out
of the car. In the lapse of—as it seemed—two or
three minutes, a splashing sound distinctly came from
below, the first noise exterior to the car which had
reached the ear of Augustine for many a weary
hour. Slight as it was, it seemed sufficient to startle
the earl from his sleep; he opened his eyes, and gave
a little start of horror at the sight of the vast
ball above him, which in an instant brought back
to him the consciousness of what had occurred.</p>

<p>“Still this living death!” he exclaimed, and his
voice awakened Mabel.</p>

<p>“It is very, very cold,” she murmured drowsily;
“and is the night really gone, and the beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
morning breaking? These soft rosy clouds are above
us now, perhaps we may see—”</p>

<p>“Do not look down, Mabel!” cried her uncle.</p>

<p>But the word came too late,—the trembling
girl was already surveying the broad, smooth ocean
plain.</p>

<p>“Where can we be going?” she exclaimed; “it is
one flat blue expanse below, and there is a scent as
if from the sea!”</p>

<p>“We must be over the Channel,” said Dashleigh;
“Augustine Aumerle, what are you doing?”</p>

<p>His friend had lifted up his box of instruments
and flung it over the side; the basket then followed.
Augustine laid his hand on the grappling irons, but
paused, till, at a shorter interval than before, the
splash was heard from the sea.</p>

<p>“Are we sinking down?” exclaimed Mabel and
Dashleigh as if with one breath.</p>

<p>Augustine nodded an assent, and threw over the
grappling irons. Nothing remained in the car
which could be flung away to lighten the balloon.</p>

<p>“Oh! what will become of us?—what will become
of us?” exclaimed Mabel, clasping her hands in
terror, as death in a new form stared her in the
face.</p>

<p>“Nothing will keep the balloon up,” said Augustine
Aumerle; “we must commend our souls to a
merciful God.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>“Can you see no ship?” cried the earl; “no
object moving on the waters?” and starting up
in the eagerness of hope, he himself looked over
the side of the car, but almost sickening at the
dizzy prospect, sank back again to his place.</p>

<p>How gloriously burst the bright rays streaming
from the eastern horizon! how splendidly rose the
sun as a monarch rejoicing in his might, crimsoning
the floating clouds, and casting across the waters a
path of quivering gold! It struck the trembling
Mabel with a sense of awful beauty, as nearer and
nearer the <i>Eaglet</i> dropped toward ocean’s liquid
grave! Again the coloured stripes of the ball shone
bright in the light of day, but it was with something
of horror that the travellers now regarded that which
Mabel had once playfully spoken of as an emblem of
swollen pride. It had carried them aloft through
the clouds to dreary, deathlike isolation, but failed
to support them now in the hour of peril and distress.</p>

<p>Down—down—down—yet with more rapid and
breathless descent, not in perpendicular fall, but
borne sideways by the freshening sea breeze, sank
the once towering <i>Eaglet</i>. The white crests of the
billows could now be distinguished, and even the fin
of a porpoise that flashed in the sunbeam.</p>

<p>“Might not the car float?” exclaimed Mabel; “it
is so buoyant and light!”</p>

<p>“It possibly might for a time,” replied Augustine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
“were it not attached to this frightful incumbrance.
Dashleigh,” he asked suddenly, “have you a knife?
I parted yesterday with mine.”</p>

<p>“For what use?” inquired the earl, as he gave
a large one which he happened to have on his
person.</p>

<p>There is no time for reply, the <i>Eaglet</i> is nearing
the sea; down—down—down—till with a violent
shock which splashes the spray many feet into the
air, the car strikes the waves and rebounds again, its
dripping, gasping occupants clinging hard to prevent
themselves from being flung out into the
sea.</p>

<p>Down again—still with terrific violence; it is a
frightful scene! The spirit of a demon appears to
animate the balloon,—a spirit that delights in torturing
its miserable victims, as it goes sweeping, dashing,
whirling on, now skimming at some height above
the surface of the waters, now suddenly dipping so
low that the half uttered shriek of Mabel is stifled in
the gasping sob of suffocation! No wretch fastened
to a wild horse plunging, rearing, bounding on its
way, with steaming nostril and foaming breath, ever
endured the horrors of those dragged onward by that
terrific engine of death, while the half submerged
car leaves a long white bubbling track on the
ocean!</p>

<p>Augustine alone loses not his presence of mind in
this crisis of unutterable horror. Though the violent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
plunging, unsteady motion of the partly exhausted
balloon makes it difficult for his half drowned companions
to keep their seats, he manages to retain his
footing without clinging, for both his hands are
engaged in a desperate effort to cut asunder the
cords of the balloon. It is their only chance of
life,—a miserable chance indeed, but better even to
sink at once in the watery depths, than to be thus
given again and again a horrible taste of death, to
be snatched away from it for a moment, only to be
precipitated downwards once more! With the
energy of despair the drowning man wields the
flashing knife, one after another the ropes are cut,
each that gives way rendering more fearful the
danger of the party—for at length the horizontal
position of the car is actually reversed, the wicker
is suspended by a single cord, and it is only by
clasping and clinging with strained muscles and
desperate grasp, that the terrified ones can retain
hold of this, the one frail barrier between themselves
and destruction!</p>

<p>Augustine awaits the moment when the lower end
of the car just touches the waves, and then the last
cord is severed! In an instant the light frame is
dashed on the billows, the waves splashing around
and over it and the three who almost miraculously
have retained their places within it. The car of
wicker work lined with oil-skin is not ill calculated
on an emergency to act the part of a boat, but it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
nearly full of water, and it is only by almost superhuman
efforts in baling out the brine with Mabel’s
straw hat and Dashleigh’s beaver (Augustine’s is
floating far on the waves) that the little shell can be
kept afloat.</p>

<p>In the meantime the balloon, released from the
weight of the car, bursts upwards like a bird of
prey soaring from a field of blood; or, to repeat
my former figure, as if the demon of pride, baffled
and wounded like Apollyon in his conflict with
Christian, had “spread his dark wings on the blast,
and fled away to his own habitation!” A wild
sensation of joy, even in the midst of her terror,
flashed across the mind of Mabel, as she saw that
terrible minister of destruction borne far away—and
for ever!</p>

<p>Perilous as was the situation of the voyagers in
their fragile boat, drenched as they were with salt
water, hungry, exhausted, their throats and lips
parched with burning thirst, they seemed but to
have exchanged one form of misery for another.
And yet the change from their late frightful position
brought with it some sense of relief. They were
touching, though not solid earth, yet some portion of
their native sphere; they were no longer floating in
an ocean of air, cut off by an impassable gulf from
the faintest hope of human assistance. There was
comfort in the sight of the lank brown sea-weed
borne on the floating waves, comfort in the sight of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
the white winged birds that dipped in the flashing
brine!</p>

<p>But as the day advanced endurance was sorely
tried. Without rudder to steer the little car, or
oar to propel, the sufferers could not shut out the
prospect before them of almost certain death. The
perpetual baling out of the water which leaked into
their crazy boat, became an exhausting effort which
their fainting frames could not for many hours
sustain. Even Augustine’s features began to acquire
the rigid sternness of despair; and the earl, in
silent supplication, commended a young widow to
God.</p>

<p>Suddenly Mabel exclaimed with wild transport:
“A sail, a sail in the horizon!”</p>

<p>“But a sea-gull floating on the waves,” replied
Augustine, shading his eyes with his hand from the
glare of a meridian sun.</p>

<p>The earl stretched out his blue corpse-like fingers
in the direction indicated by Mabel, and then,
raising his hand on high, exclaimed, “It is a sail—help
is near—God be praised! God be praised!”</p>

<p>Then followed a time of intense, almost maddening
excitement. Augustine stood erect in the car,
his tall form raised to its utmost height, as he waved
again and again a kerchief as a signal of distress.</p>

<p>“Oh, if they should not see it!” exclaimed Mabel</p>

<p>“Or seeing, disregard it,” murmured the earl.</p>

<p>Again and again a shrill cry for help sounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
over the blue expanse. If the freshening breeze
bore back that cry, so that it reached not the ears
for which it was intended, that same breeze was
filling the canvas and bringing near and more near
the wished for,—the prayed for relief!</p>

<p>“I think that they see us!” cried Augustine, for
the first time during that terrible day a gleam of
joy relaxing his features.</p>

<p>“Oh, my beloved father—my own Ida—shall I
behold you again!” exclaimed Mabel.</p>

<p>“We must not relax our efforts,” said her uncle,
“or we shall perish even in the view of safety.”</p>

<p>She speeds on,—the gallant bark,—dashing onwards
“like a thing of life;” the figure of the
steersman is now distinctly visible at her prow, his
rough hail rings clear over the water,—was ever
sight so welcome, was ever sound so sweet! Joy
in that never-to-be-forgotten moment proves more
overpowering even than terror, and the firmness
which had stood the strain of most intense anxiety
and fear gives way in the rebound of rapturous
thanksgiving and delight!</p>

<p>On the eventful night which had been passed by
the earl and his companions above the clouds, the
mourners in the vicarage had known but little of
repose. If oblivion came, it was in brief troubled
snatches of slumber, from which the fevered sleeper
awakes with a start to feel an icy oppression on the
mind,—slumber which has in it nothing of refreshment.</p>

<p>All arose very early, with a vague yearning hope
that tidings might come with the morning light,
and the eager greeting when two of that anxious
household met together was always, “Have you
heard?—are there any tidings?”</p>

<p>Annabella would not appear at the breakfast
table. Ida, pale as sculptured marble, scarcely able
to swallow the nourishment of which she partook as
a duty, sat beside her father, every sense absorbed
in anxious listening. She heard the postman’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
step before she could see his form, and eagerly sprang
forward to meet him, for it was possible—just
possible—that he might be the bearer of news!</p>

<p>The man shook his head sadly when questioned;
he had brought nothing but a parcel for the
Countess of Dashleigh with the London post-mark
upon it; and, with a sickening sense of disappointment,
Ida bore it to the room of her cousin.</p>

<p>A strange gleam of hope flashed in the countess’s
large hollow eyes, as, without noticing the post-mark,
she tore open the little packet; it was followed by a
strange revulsion of feeling. There lay before her,
beautiful in its fanciful binding of violet and gold,
its glittering edges bright from the hand of the
gilder, “<i><span class="smcap">The Fairy Lake</span>, by the <span class="smcap">Countess of
Dashleigh</span></i>.”</p>

<p>There was a time when the youthful authoress
would have gazed on the volume with delight, and
turned over its pages with eager curiosity and
pleasure! But now—there seemed written upon
each a tale of wilful rebellion and insolent pride!
Annabella flung her first book from her with an
exclamation of anguish, for was it not connected in
her mind with the fearful fate of her husband!</p>

<p>Then, with a sudden resolution, she rose from her
seat, and hastily opened that desk at which she had
penned her fatal article for the —— Magazine.
Annabella would make some reparation, such reparation
as yet was possible, for the deed so deeply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
repented of. The countess wrote, with a hand that
shook so that she could scarcely form the letters, a
note to her publisher in London, bidding him at once
cancel the whole edition of her romance, prohibiting
him from selling a single copy of the work which he
had been hurrying through the press, and making
herself responsible for his losses, whatever they might
be. No earthly consideration would have induced
the miserable wife to delay, even for an hour, the
act by which she crushed the bud of hope, so long
eagerly fostered, at the very moment when it burst
into blossom! The young authoress, once soaring so
high in the pride of literary ambition, was cutting
the cords of her balloon!</p>

<p>Almost every family in the neighbourhood, whether
rich or poor, called at the vicarage that day, impelled
by friendship, curiosity, or pity, to inquire if
any tidings of the lost balloon had reached the
family of the Aumerles. No visitors, however, were
admitted, as soon as it was ascertained that they had
come to receive information, and not to give it.
The sound of wheels, and of frequent rings at the
gate, almost drove Annabella to distraction! Ida
and her father spent much of the time together in
fervent prayer, but the miserable Countess of Dashleigh
seemed too restless—too wretched to pray!</p>

<p>It was now the afternoon of one of the loveliest
days in the loveliest of seasons. The soft tinkling
of the distant sheep-bell, the low of the cattle in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
meadow, and the monotonous hum of the bee, came
softly blended together to the ear. The bright
mantle of sunshine fell on fruit-trees laden with
blossom,—the hawthorn white with May’s perfumed
snow, the fragrant lilac, the laburnum dropping its
showers of gold! Annabella gazed from the open
casement of her apartment upon a lovely and varied
prospect, but she had not the slightest perception of
what lay directly before her eye.</p>

<p>Another loud ring! The countess turned her
head with quick impatience. A man was standing
at the gate. Was there something in his manner
that announced the eager bearer of tidings, or did
the wife intuitively grasp the fact that he brought
her news of her husband? Ida seemed to have had
the same perception, for, with the breeze waving
back her long dark tresses, she was at the gate
almost before the tongue of the bell ceased to
vibrate. Annabella saw her start, caught the
uttered exclamation, and springing from her room,
clearing the stairs almost at a bound, in less than a
minute was at the side of her cousin. She was
quickly followed by the vicar and Mrs. Aumerle, and
every member of the household.</p>

<p>A telegraphic message had arrived from Augustine;
yes, there was the precious little leaf, which, like the
touch of a magician’s wand, changed the face of
everything around, and flooded the dry, haggard
cheek of sorrow with a torrent of grateful tears.</p>

<p>“Safe, thank God! I shall send M—— home to-morrow. I
remain here with the earl, who is attacked by brain fever. I have
telegraphed to Exeter for Dr. G—— and a nurse.—A. A.”</p>

</div>

<p>“Brain fever!” exclaimed the countess with a
gasp.</p>

<p>“Temporary illness, I trust,—only temporary,”
said the vicar, from whose heart the weight of a
mountain seemed removed. “Augustine, thoughtful
as he ever is, has already taken every human means
to insure recovery.”</p>

<p>“My Reginald shall be left to no nurse; no, no,
none shall rob me of one privilege,” cried Annabella.
“I will be at B—— beside him to-night.”</p>

<p>“I will be your escort,” said Lawrence Aumerle.</p>

<p>“Oh, take me too!” exclaimed Ida, her dark
eyes swimming in tears at the thought of seeing her
sister.</p>

<p>“No, no,” interrupted Mrs. Aumerle, “numbers are
by no means desirable where a man in brain fever is
concerned. It is bad enough for your father to have
to undertake a long journey, without the whole
family hurrying off. You will stay here with me,
my dear, and welcome back Mabel to-morrow.”</p>

<p>A short time before Ida would have rebelled
against a decision so much at variance with her
inclinations,—would have remonstrated, or at least
have murmured; but she had received too severe a
lesson for its impression to be speedily effaced, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
reproaching herself for the sigh which alone betrayed
her disappointment, she hastened up-stairs to prepare
a little parcel of necessaries to be taken to Mabel.</p>

<p>As Ida was putting up, with other articles, the
Bible which she knew that her sister would especially
welcome, she was unexpectedly joined by Mrs.
Aumerle.</p>

<p>“You may leave that business to me,” said the
lady, with more real kindness of intention than
tenderness of manner; “your father says that it
would be hard not to let you make one of the
party, so you had better get ready for the journey
at once.”</p>

<p>Joyful at the permission, Ida hastened to make
her little preparations; and Mrs. Aumerle, as she
packed Mabel’s parcel, informed her step-daughter
of the arrangements which she had herself made for
the convenience of all. A messenger had been
promptly despatched to the nearest neighbour who
kept a carriage, to ask the loan of the conveyance to
carry the travellers to the nearest railway station.
Nothing that could insure the comfort of the vicar
was forgotten when his carpet-bag was packed by
the hands of his careful wife; Ida received sundry
injunctions to watch over the health of her father,
and the good housewife took care that the travellers
should not fast on the way.</p>

<p>When the carriage drove away from the door of
the vicarage, with its eager, anxious occupants, Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
Aumerle, following it to the gate, watched it from
thence till it disappeared in a turn of the road. And
thus the woman of sense soliloquised on events, past,
present, and future:—</p>

<p>“How much trouble and misery has been caused
by one act of selfish folly! Because Augustine—too
great a genius, I suppose, to judge like a sensible
man—fancies to roam through the clouds, and take
with him a wilful, disobedient child, while a petulant
girl eggs on her husband to follow so absurd
an example, a whole family must be plunged into
terror, grief, and alarm! I felt convinced from the
first that all would end happily enough. Augustine
has easily guided the balloon; it has floated quietly
down at its leisure to some quiet meadow in Devon;
and but for the poor earl’s shaken nerves, the whole
affair to those most concerned has been nothing but
a party of pleasure! It is we who have had to
suffer for the senseless folly of others. There’s Ida
has been looking like a spectre; and my dear,
excellent husband is first almost crushed with sorrow,
and then hurried off, at half-an-hour’s notice, to
escort that half frantic countess to a husband who
will probably refuse to see her! Well, well, I
believe that of all senses common sense is the most
uncommon!” and with a soothing conviction that a
portion, at least, of the rare gift had been bestowed
upon herself, Mrs. Aumerle quietly returned to her
usual avocations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>It was fortunate for Mabel that the morrow’s
post brought to her stepmother’s hands the letter
which the young girl had dropped from the balloon.
Ida had left a request, that notes addressed to her
might in her absence be opened by Mrs. Aumerle,
and thus it was that that lady first became aware
of some of the perils through which the travellers
had passed. Mabel’s letter had been picked up in
a field and posted by the farmer who had found it,
and the touching lines of love and penitence which
she had penned in the near prospect of a terrible
death, softened in a very great degree the feelings of
her step-mother towards her.</p>

<p>“She has had her share of suffering after all,”
observed the lady, “and we must not be severe
upon the poor child. She has had punishment
enough for her fault, so I’m content to ‘let bygones
be bygones.’”</p>

<p>When the Countess of Dashleigh, with bitter words
of reproach, had departed from the cottage of Bardon,
she left her late entertainers in a state of mind little
to be envied. The unfortunate Cecilia was for the
rest of the day much in the position of one who,
with hands tied, is caged up with a large hornet
which has been irritated, and which goes about
buzzing with evident determination to find or to
make a foe. Everything went wrong with the
doctor, and his daughter was the only being within
reach of the hornet’s sting!</p>

<p>Bardon’s temper broke out especially at dinner,
where every little luxury which had been prepared
for Annabella served as a provocation to her irritated
host. The unfortunate chicken (a delicacy till lately
almost unknown at the little cottage), could not
have been more denounced as tough, tasteless, and
uneatable, if it had been a roasted owl. The tartlets
(made surreptitiously by poor Cecilia in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
absence of Mrs. Bates) roused such an angry storm
against all the inventors, makers, and eaters of such
abominable trash, that Cecilia silently resolved that
they should never appear on the table again; she
would rather throw them into the road! Miss
Bardon’s gaily tinted bubble of grandeur had
broken, and left behind nothing but bitterness and—bills!</p>

<p>The fact was that Dr. Bardon was angry with
himself, though a great deal too proud to own it.
He was haunted by the countenance of the unfortunate
Dashleigh as he last had seen it in the car, and
had a strong persuasion on his mind that the earl,
in a fit of frenzy, would fling himself out of the
balloon, and be dashed to pieces in the fall! The
subject of the ascent of the <i>Eaglet</i> was one so painful
to Bardon that he would endure no allusion to
it; and Cecilia soon discovered that there was no
method of raising a storm so certain, as that of
uttering aloud the conjectures and apprehensions to
which such an event naturally gave rise. Silence,
particularly on so interesting a subject, was a cruel
penance to the poor lady, to whom gossip was one
of the few remaining pleasures of life, but to that
penance she was obliged to submit as being the
lesser of two evils.</p>

<p>The anxious vicar himself had not passed a more
disturbed night with the images of his child and
his brother breaking his rest, than did the proud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
old doctor. Conscience had at length made him
miserable, although it had not made him meek. He
was no longer stormy, but he was sullen; and he
did not even choose to communicate to his daughter
his intention of calling on the Aumerles as soon as
his breakfast should be concluded, in order to inquire
whether anything had been heard of the missing
balloon.</p>

<p>The postman, who had just left at the vicarage
“The Fairy Lake” for the Countess of Dashleigh,
now called at the cottage with a letter. The doctor’s
correspondents were so very few in number that
such an event was sufficiently rare to excite attention;
and Bardon’s mind was so pre-occupied with
the idea of coming misfortune and death, that he
turned pale on seeing that the epistle directed to
him was sealed and deep-bordered with black.</p>

<p>Cecilia, who had her full allowance of natural
curiosity, watched the countenance of her father as
he broke open and perused the letter. She saw his
colour return, while his eye-brows were elevated as
if in surprise; he read the epistle twice without
comment, and then silently handed it over to his
daughter.</p>

<p>The letter was a formal notification from the
executors of the late Thomas Auger, Esq., that that
gentleman had, by a will executed but a few days
previous to his decease, given and bequeathed the
dwelling-house called Nettleby Tower, and the land<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
appertaining thereto, to Timon Bardon, M.D., the
only surviving son of their former proprietor; and
that he willed also that the said Timon Bardon
should be paid from his estate a sum equal to that
which had been expended by him in his lawsuit
with the testator for the property above mentioned.</p>

<p>Cecilia, almost as much delighted as she was surprised,
glanced up eagerly at her father. She read
no exultation in his countenance, but rather a
thoughtful sorrow, which his daughter could scarcely
understand. Could she have penetrated his reflections,
they would have appeared somewhat like the
following: “Such, then, was the last act of the man
whom I hated, over the announcement of whose
death I gloated with malignant triumph! He
remembered me on his death-bed; while struggling
with the last enemy, he sought to make reparation
for a wrong committed years ago, but never forgotten
or forgiven by me. Through his sense of justice, I
am at length restored to the home and estate of my
fathers. Prosperity is sent to me, but through a
channel so unexpected, and at a moment so painful,
that I scarcely know how to welcome it, for I feel
as though I did not deserve it.”</p>

<p>“Papa,” cried Cecilia, “do you not rejoice?”</p>

<p>Bardon turned silently away. To compare
greater things with less, his were something of the
emotions of a child who has justly incurred a
parent’s displeasure, and who, while awaiting in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
spirit of sullen rebellion a further manifestation of
wrath, is surprised by a sudden token of love, unexpected
as unmerited. The child, if a spark of generous
feeling be left in his nature, is more pained by the
kindness of his offended parent than he would have
been by a sign of anger. His heart is melted; his
conscience is touched. Timon Bardon had hardened
his heart in adversity; he had girt on the panoply
of pride; he had gloried in his powers of endurance,
as one ready to do battle with the world, and to
trample down all its frivolous distinctions. He had
been ever trying to conceal the fact that he was a
sad and disappointed man, both from himself and
others, by affecting a contempt for all the worldly
advantages which Providence had seen fit to deny;
but to have these advantages suddenly restored to
him, and at a period when he was conscious,—could
not but be conscious,—that he had merited a
Father’s chastening rod, had a much more softening
effect upon him than would have been produced by
adversity’s heaviest stroke. The tidings which
came in the evening of the safety of the travellers
in the <i>Eaglet</i>, gave a much keener sense of pleasure
to Bardon than had been produced by the news of
the morning.</p>

<p>And now we will return to the countess and her
companions. The horses of their carriage were
urged to speed, yet were they barely in time to
catch the train, and the party had scarcely taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
their seats before it began to move on. Oh, how
Annabella longed to give the wings of her own impatience
to the lagging engine! How her yearning
spirit realized the complaint,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Miles interminably spread,</div>
<div class="verse">Seem lengthening as I go!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Night had closed around before the travellers
reached the little station which was nearest to
the place of their destination,—a small, lonely post at
which the train merely stopped for two minutes to
suffer the party to alight.</p>

<p>“Can any conveyance be procured here?” asked
Aumerle of the solitary station official who was
assisting to put down their luggage.</p>

<p>“No, sir,” was the unsatisfactory reply. “There
was a chaise sent here two hours ago for a gentleman
who came by last train; nothing of the kind
is to be had here, unless it’s ordered aforehand from
the town.”</p>

<p>“Is that chaise likely to return hither?”</p>

<p>“Can’t say, sir,” answered the man. “I believe
that it took a doctor and nurse to a place where a
nobleman’s lying ill, who was picked up to-day from
the sea.”</p>

<p>“The sea!” echoed the astonished listeners.</p>

<p>“Fallen out of a balloon, as I understand,” said
the man. “There was a party of three, and they
were all saved by one of our fishing-smacks that was
just coming in from a cruise.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, guide us to the place where they are!” exclaimed
the countess.</p>

<p>“Can’t leave the station, ma’am,” replied the
official, looking with some curiosity and interest on
the pale, eager face on which the light of the gas-lamp
fell; “besides, I’ve not been long at this
place, and don’t know exactly where the cottage lies.”</p>

<p>“What are we to do?” exclaimed Ida.</p>

<p>“Now I think on it,” said the station-man,
slowly, “the doctor asked me when the last train
would go back to Exeter to-night. I take it he’s
likely to return; and you could have the chaise that
brings him.”</p>

<p>“When does that train pass?” inquired the vicar.</p>

<p>“Within an hour,” replied the man, glancing
round at the large clock behind him. “Will not the
ladies walk into the waiting-room?—it is better than
standing out here on the platform.”</p>

<p>“It appears our best course,” said the vicar, addressing
the countess, “to await here the return of
the doctor, and avail ourselves of the only conveyance
that seems likely to call here to-night.”</p>

<p>“Oh no, no!” exclaimed Annabella, wildly;
“every minute of delay is an age in purgatory!
The doctor may never come. Augustine will not
suffer him to quit Dashleigh for an hour! I wait
for no one; I will try to find my way to the
cottage;—I go at once, even if I go alone!”</p>

<p>As Annabella remained firm in her resolution, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
party, after gleaning such scanty information as the
man at the station could give, and procuring from
him a lantern, set out on their dreary way. Perfect
darkness is seldom known in Devon on a night in
May, but clouds and the absence of the moon rendered
the atmosphere unusually obscure. Strange and
phantom-like looked the black shadows of their
own forms to the travellers, as the glare of the
lantern cast them on the chalky cliffs that bordered
their road. The path was rough and steep, strewn
with stone boulders here and there, which seemed to
have rolled down from the rocky heights above.</p>

<p>After a long, toilsome struggle up a gorge, where
the countess much needed the aid of the vicar’s arm,
the party emerged on the summit of a hill, whence
in daylight they would have commanded an extensive
prospect. Now faint gleams of summer light alone
revealed to them by glimpses what appeared to be
a wild, rocky valley, sloping down on the left to the
sea, the mournful murmur of whose billows came
upon the sighing breeze. Viewed by the imperfect
light, the scene was very desolate and drear, and in
its gloomy sublimity struck a chill to the heart of
Annabella.</p>

<p>“It is like the valley of the shadow of death!”
she whispered to Ida Aumerle.</p>

<p>“Even were it so, dearest,” was the reply, “is it
not beyond the dark valley that the land of promise
lies?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>“To those who are sure of a welcome,” faltered
forth the unhappy countess.</p>

<p>“I think that I hear the sound of wheels,” observed
the vicar; “yes,—some vehicle is evidently
slowly ascending the steep hill before us.”</p>

<p>“Surely that of Dr. G—— upon its return,” suggested
Ida.</p>

<p>The idea made all quicken their steps. Ida’s
guess had been partially correct; in front was the
expected chaise, moving as if towards the station.</p>

<p>As soon as the vehicle was sufficiently near, Mr.
Aumerle hailed the driver:—</p>

<p>“Whence do you come, my friend?”</p>

<p>“From Cliff Cottage,” replied a rough voice
through the darkness, and then the panting of a horse
was heard.</p>

<p>“Is it the doctor?” exclaimed Annabella, pressing
eagerly forward.</p>

<p>“No,” replied the voice. “A gentleman is ill;
the doctor is staying the night; I’m to return for
him in the morning;” and the speaker cracked his
whip as a signal to the weary horse to move forward.</p>

<p>Arrangements were speedily made with the driver
by Mr. Aumerle; the conveyance was turned round
at the first convenient spot, and in it the ladies and
the vicar were soon on their way to the cottage in
which the Earl of Dashleigh lay ill.</p>

<p>Few words were interchanged as the travellers
descended the rough, and almost precipitous road;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
indeed, the violent jolting would, under any circumstances,
have rendered conversation impossible. Progress
was necessarily slow, and it was some time
before the party reached a lonely, shingle-built
cottage belonging to a fisherman, which stood almost
on the margin of the sea.</p>

<p>There was no need to knock at the low, rude door,
for a quick ear within had caught the sound of
wheels, most unusual in that lonely spot, and the
vicar had scarcely had time to alight, before Mabel
was in the arms of her father!</p>

And Ida—my own precious Ida!” The poor young
girl clung to her sister as if they had been parted

<p>“My husband!” exclaimed Annabella, trembling
lest terrible news should await her.</p>

<p>“He is much the same, but—”</p>

<p>“Where is he—I will fly to him; I—”</p>

<p>“My dear madam,” said the low voice of a
stranger, as a tall, bald gentleman in black came
forth from the interior of the cottage, with his finger
raised to his lip, “may I request that no sound be
uttered—my patient is in a state of high fever.”</p>

<p>“I will quietly glide up to his room—”</p>

<p>“If, as I suppose, I have the honour of addressing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
the Countess of Dashleigh, I trust that she will
pardon my strictly forbidding any one but Mr.
Aumerle and the nurse from entering the chamber
of the earl.”</p>

<p>“I am his wife!” murmured Annabella hoarsely.</p>

<p>“It is impossible,” said Dr. G——, “that you should
meet without a degree of excitement which might
endanger the life or the reason of my patient. The
earl is in excellent hands; his friend, and the skilful
attendant whom I have provided, will watch him
night and day. If any new face were to be
seen, I would not be answerable for the consequences.”</p>

<p>Dr. G—— had, of course, read “The Precipice and the
Peer,” and naturally concluded that its authoress was
the last person who could with impunity be admitted
into the sick-room of the excited and fevered patient.
From the physician’s decision there was no appeal,
though to Annabella it appeared an intolerable sentence
of banishment from the place to which both
duty and affection called her. Always ready to rush
to a conclusion, the unhappy wife was convinced
that it was the just resentment of Dashleigh against
her, that rendered her of all beings in the world
the one whose presence he could not endure.
Utterly prostrate and helpless in her sorrow, the
countess left to Ida all care for the arrangements of
the night. To herself it was nothing where she
slept, or whether she ever should sleep again; she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
was like a flower so crushed and bruised that it will
never more unfold its petals to the sun.</p>

<p>The rude cottage of the fisherman offered wretched
accommodation for so large a party. The earl occupied
one of the two little bed-rooms which were reached
by a ladder-like staircase; in the other—an apartment
not ten feet square, with bare rafters, sloping
roof, and single-paned window engrained with dust
and sea salt, and incapable of being opened—the countess
and her cousins passed the night. The gentlemen
had to content themselves with the bare floor of
the kitchen below, redolent of the scent of fish, and
garlanded with nets and tackle,—an accommodation
which they shared with their rough, weather-beaten,
but hospitable host.</p>

<p>Annabella and Ida were so much exhausted by
previous excitement, fatigue, and want of rest, that
even in the miserable hovel they might have slept
deeply and long, had it not been for the sounds from
the next room, almost as distinctly heard through
the slight partition as if the apartments had been one.
It was agony to the countess to hear the moans of
the fevered sufferer, or the wild words uttered in
delirium. Ida passed the night in vain endeavours
to soothe and calm a wounded spirit, while the weary
Mabel peacefully slumbered beside them, unconscious
of what was passing around. It was almost as great
a relief to Ida as to her afflicted cousin when the
morning broke at length, and welcome silence on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
other side of the partition told that the sufferer had
sunk to rest.</p>

<p>Augustine Aumerle, after watching for hours at
the bedside of the earl, whom he alone had any
power to soothe in the paroxysms of his terrible
malady, now resigned his post to the nurse, and descending
the steep, narrow staircase, went forth to
calm and refresh his spirit by a brief walk on the
shore of the sea,—that sea in which he had so lately
expected to find a grave. As he stood gazing on
the bright expanse of waters, and enjoying the fresh
morning breeze that, as it rippled the surface of the
sea, also brought back the hue of health to his pale and
careworn cheek, he was joined by Lawrence Aumerle.</p>

<p>Kindly greeting was exchanged between the
brothers; questions were asked and replies were
given, and then a silence succeeded. Something
seemed pressing on the heart of each, to which the
lip would not give ready utterance. Augustine was
the first to speak, but he did so without looking at
his brother; he rather seemed to be watching the
sea-bird that lightly floated on the wave.</p>

<p>“Lawrence, you remember the evening when we
conversed together in your study?”</p>

<p>“I have often thought of it since.”</p>

<p>“And so have I,” said Augustine; “I thought of
it when I believed that there was but one step between
me and death,—when I expected in a brief
space to be in that world where we shall know even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
as we are known,—where ours will not be the wild
guess, but the absolute certainty,—not the wild
grasping at the shadow, but the laying hold on the
substance of truth.”</p>

<p>Lawrence fixed his eyes anxiously upon his
brother, but did not interrupt him by a word.</p>

<p>“You said that experience is the growth of time.
Lawrence, I have, then, lived an age in the last forty
hours. A wide view of both heaven and earth is
gained from the terrible height that I reached!”</p>

<p>“Common experience is the growth of time,” said
the vicar; “but spiritual experience—”</p>

<p>“Give it in the words of inspiration,” interrupted
Augustine; “I shall no longer ask you to put aside
that solemn evidence, even for a moment. <em>Tribulation
worketh patience; and patience, experience.</em>”</p>

<p>“<em>And experience, hope</em>;” cried the vicar. “Oh,
my brother!—that blessed hope shed abroad in the
heart by the knowledge that Christ <em>died for the
ungodly</em>, that hope that alone <em>maketh not ashamed</em>,
is it—oh! is it your own?”</p>

<p>Augustine silently pressed the hand that had been
unconsciously extended towards him; it was his only
reply to the question. Without another sentence
being uttered the brothers turned their steps in the
direction of the cottage. But while pacing the
shingley beach, Augustine was mentally subscribing
to the confession of one of the brightest geniuses
of earth,—that he had hitherto been but as a child<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
gathering pebbles on the shore of the great ocean of
truth; while the vicar was raising to God, from the
depths of a grateful heart, a thanksgiving for prayer
answered at the very time when, and through the
very trial by which his earthly happiness had appeared
crushed and destroyed! He was proving, as
so many saints have proved, that—</p>

<p>As no object could be answered by the prolonged
stay of Mr. Aumerle and Mabel in the over-crowded
cottage, they departed on that day for their home.
The countess could not endure to quit the spot, and
Ida remained to bear her company, while Augustine
resumed his watch by his suffering friend.</p>

<p>Day after day the once proud Earl of Dashleigh
lay on a pallet-bed in the fisherman’s rude hovel,
mind and body alike prostrated by the fever induced
by the fearful trials which he had endured. He was
passing indeed through a burning fiery furnace, but
its flame was consuming the dross which had largely
mixed with a nobler metal. When the powers of
good and evil contend together for the dominion over
a human soul, it is as in the battles of earth; dark
and painful traces are often left behind of the conflict,
conquest is not attained without suffering.
Never, perhaps, is the strife more painful than when
the enemy to be subdued is pride! Then how often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
a merciful Providence sends humiliation, anguish, disgrace,
first to rouse the soul to a sense of its danger,
and then to aid it in the perilous war! From how
much of suffering is exempted the <em>meek and quiet
spirit</em> that has calmly laid down the shackles of
pride, not left them till some loving yet terrible dispensation
should wrench them away from the bleeding
soul!</p>

<p>Annabella was deeply humbled; there was some
danger that depression might with her sink into
hopeless despondency. Her ardent and volatile disposition
was ever prone to extremes, and she could
not believe it possible that her proud lord could ever
forgive one who had wounded his dignity so deeply,—one
whose indiscretion had so nearly cost him his
life! The forced inaction to which she had to submit
greatly increased the trial to Annabella. If it
had been possible for her to have done or suffered
anything in order to repair the evil that she had
wrought, she would have contemplated its effects
with less overwhelming remorse. Had the countess
belonged to the Church of Rome, she would have
wasted her strength with fasting, lacerated her flesh
by the scourge, or gone on some painful pilgrimage
in the hope of redeeming her fault. As it was, she
had to sit still—useless, helpless, receiving from time
to time tidings of her husband’s varying state from
the lips of ministering strangers! Annabella’s spirit
might have altogether sunk under the lengthened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
trial, but for the support of Ida’s calmer and more
chastened spirit, which had itself found its stay on
the Rock of Ages.</p>

<p>On the sixth day of Dashleigh’s illness, his wife
received from her home a small packet, containing
the little pocket-book which had been her own earliest
gift to her betrothed. The beautiful remembrance
had been accidentally discovered at no great distance
from the letter which Mabel had dropped; but its
comparative weight had made it fall with an impetus
that had half imbedded it in the sod. Easily identified
by the coronet and name upon the shield, which
marked it as the property of the unfortunate nobleman,
with whose fate the county was ringing, it had
been forwarded to Dashleigh Hall, and thence—still
stained and clotted with dust and mud—it had been
sent on by her servants to the countess.</p>

<p>Annabella gazed on the book for some moments
without daring to unfasten the clasp. The sight of
that little gift brought with it a crowd of recollections
of the time when wedded life had lain before
fancy’s eye as a bright, golden-clasped book, on whose
yet blank pages hope, pleasure, and love, would trace
nothing but sentences of joy! Why was it that the
leaves of that life had been blistered and blotted with
tears,—that the gold had been tarnished, the beauty
marred, and that the once joyous bride now dreaded
even to look upon what that book might contain!</p>

<p>“Open it for me, Ida, dearest,” murmured Annabella<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
faintly; “I tremble to behold what his fingers
may have traced in that terrible hour!”</p>

<p>Ida silently obeyed, kneeling at the side of her
unhappy cousin, whose cold hand rested upon her
shoulder. Ida turned slowly leaf after leaf. There
were various memoranda in the book, evidently
written at an earlier period—addresses of friends,
names of books, engagements for days long passed.
Little of interest or importance could attach to entries
such as these. But almost at the end of the book,
on a page otherwise blank, appeared two words in
pencil, traced evidently by a hand that had shaken
from weakness, excitement, or emotion. The words
were barely legible, but such as they were Ida with
tremulous eagerness pointed them out to her friend.
Annabella caught the book from her hand, pressed it
convulsively to her lips, and while her eyes overflowed
with tears and her heart with thanksgiving,
repeated again and again the two blessed words which
spoke <em>forgiveness</em> and <em>peace</em>!</p>

<p>Even while the young wife’s tears were still flowing,
a gentle tap was heard at the door. Ida went
and unclosed it; there was a low whispering sound,
and then the maiden returned to her cousin with a
gentle smile on her face as she said, laying her hand
on that of the countess, “It is my uncle, dearest; he
comes to bring you good tidings. The earl is greatly
better,—has been speaking to him,—has been questioning
him of you; he knows—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>“Knows that I am here!” exclaimed Annabella,
starting eagerly from her seat.</p>

<p>“Yes, and wishes to see you,—nay, dearest, nay,
you must be calm,—for his sake you must still this
wild excitement! Remember that he is still very
weak,—remember the danger of a relapse!”</p>

<p>“I am quite calm,” replied the young countess,
collecting herself by a strong effort, though her
quivering voice still betrayed her emotion; “I will
do nothing to agitate my lord,—he shall not even
hear a word from my lips,—but oh! the bliss if I may
once—but once hear from his those precious words,
<em>forgiveness</em> and <em>peace</em>!”</p>

<p>With soft, noiseless step she glided to the low
rough-hewn door which opened into the room of her
husband. Gently Annabella pushed it ajar, and
entered with a throbbing heart, and a mien as reverential
and timid as if she were approaching some
solemn fane. That low dark room, with uncarpeted
floor, unpapered walls, furniture coarse and scanty
contained what she now felt was all the world to
her.</p>

<p>No human friend intruded his presence on the
sacredness of that scene which ever after, to the
memory of Annabella, hallowed that fisherman’s hut.
When the penitent wife knelt in lowly contrition by
the pallet of a husband so narrowly rescued from the
jaws of the grave, and listened breathlessly to the
feeble accents which told her that the past was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
cancelled,—that she was dear as ever to him still, angels
may have looked on rejoicing as upon a prodigal’s return,
for no looming shadow darkened the holy
radiance of returning peace and love, no discord jarred
on the harmony of wedded souls,—the demon of pride
was not there!</p>

<p>Gloriously poured down the fervid rays of a July
sun, colouring the peach on the wall, swelling the rich
fig under its clustering leaves, ripening the purple
grape, and over the corn fields throwing a mantle of
gold! No longer in the fisherman’s hovel, but reclining
on a sofa in the countess’s splendid boudoir,
we find the Earl of Dashleigh, yet pale from recent
illness; the outline of the sunken cheek, the violet
tint beneath the eyes, the whiteness of the transparent
skin, tell of suffering severe and protracted, but
health and strength are returning to his frame, while
to the restored invalid lately released from the confinement
of a sick room—</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>By the softened light which steals in through the
green venetians, the earl has been whiling away the
languid, luxurious hour of noon by perusing a volume
of light literature, in which he has found great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
amusement; that volume, bound in violet and gold,
is now lying on the sofa beside him; we recognise in
it “<span class="smcap">The Fairy Lake</span>,” written by the Countess of
Dashleigh.</p>

<p>Annabella is seated on a low ottoman beside her
lord. She has been listening with pleased attention
to his remarks and comments upon her work.</p>

<p>“Perhaps, after all,” observes Dashleigh, laying his
hand on the book, “it <em>is</em> hard to restrict to a few
that which might afford pleasure to the many, and
to deprive the young authoress of the praise and the
fame which publication would bring her.”</p>

<p>“O Reginald!” replies his wife with glistening
eyes, “your praise to me outweighs that of the world,
and empty fame is nothing in comparison to a husband’s
heart! It would pain me if any eye but yours
should ever look on that which I must ever regard
as a monument of my own disobedience.”</p>

<p>Annabella’s manner towards her husband has
undergone a change since their re-union in the fisherman’s
cottage. She is gradually resuming her playfulness
of conversation, and the wit in which the earl
delights still sparkles for his amusement; but there is
more, far more of submission to his authority, and of
deference to his wishes in her demeanour; Annabella no
longer desires to forget that her vow was not only
to love, but to obey.</p>

<p>This change is chiefly owing to that which has
passed over the earl himself. His spirit by intense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
suffering has been purified, exalted, refined. That
respect which he once claimed on account of his rank
is yielded readily on account of his character. Annabella
had been disposed to ridicule a dignity that
rested on an empty title; her spirit of opposition had
been roused, and she had gloried in showing herself
above the meanness of aristocratic pride, conscious
of a loftier claim to the world’s regard than a coronet
or a pedigree could give. But if the countess still
knows herself to be superior to her husband in intellectual
attainments, in moral qualifications she now
feels herself far his inferior. Annabella has a quick
perception of character, an intuitive reverence for what
is solid and real; when she sees beneficence free from
ostentation, purity of language and life adopted, not
because the reverse would disgrace a peer, but because
it would be unworthy of a Christian, she renders
the natural homage of an ingenuous heart to virtue,
and obedience and tender affection follow in the track
of respect.</p>

<p>The conversation has taken a new turn. The earl
and his wife have fallen into a train of discourse on
some of the occurrences which have been related in
preceding chapters. Annabella has now no concealment
from her husband, and his gentleness invites
her confidence.</p>

<p>“It appears, my love,” remarked Dashleigh, “that
you quitted the home of the Bardons with scant
ceremony and little courtesy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>“He had deserved none,” replied Annabella, with
something of her old haughtiness in her tone, for
very bitter were the memories connected with Timon
Bardon.</p>

<p>“There is but one man,” pursued the earl, “who,
as far as I know, entertains any feeling of resentment
against me, or has any just cause to do so. That
man is Dr. Bardon.”</p>

<p>“It is you who have just cause for resentment
against him,” said the countess.</p>

<p>“His pride and mine clashed together, and like the
collision of flint and steel produced the angry spark
which set his spirit in a flame. But, Annabella, I
now desire to be at peace with all men. I have never
returned the doctor’s visit,—you and I will do so to-day.”</p>

<p>Annabella opened her large eyes so wide at a proposition
so unexpected, as to raise a smile on the lips
of the earl.</p>

<p>“You think that I am still too proud to let the
red liveries of the Dashleighs be seen at the door of
Mill Cottage?”</p>

<p>“If you were to invade that little nest,” said the
countess, “you would find that the birds had flown.
Do you not remember that Dr. Bardon is now the
proprietor of Nettleby Tower?”</p>

<p>“Ah! I recollect—by Auger’s will, was it not?”
replied Dashleigh, raising his thin hand to his brow.
“But this need make no difference in our arrangement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
for a visit. We will order the carriage in the
cool of the eve, and drive over to wish the old man
and his daughter joy on their return to the family
mansion.”</p>

<p>Annabella turned upon her husband a look of admiration
and love. She knew how much it must
cost him to make the first step towards reconciliation
with a man who had wronged, hated, and insulted
him. Never, even in the earliest days of their union,
had Dashleigh possessed such influence over the affections
of his young wife, as he gained by the simple,
unostentatious act which marked a conquest over
Pride and self.</p>

<p>The sun was sloping towards the west, bathing
earth and sky in the rich glory of his streaming rays,
changing the clouds into floating islands of roses, and
lighting up a little river which flowed through the
landscape, till it glittered like a thread of gold, as
Timon Bardon led a party of guests, comprising all
the family of the Aumerles, to the summit of his grey
old tower, to survey the extensive and beautiful
prospect.</p>

<p>Many a word of admiration was spoken as the
vicar and his party moved from one spot to another,
finding new beauties wherever they gazed. Cecilia,
elegantly dressed as became the lady of the mansion,
appeared in her glory, doing the honours of the
place to her guests. If anything tended in the least
degree to damp her delight, it was her perception<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
that the practical eye of Mrs. Aumerle (notwithstanding
sundry improvements in the dwelling
wrought out under Miss Bardon’s direction), had
detected many an unsightly heap of rubbish, many
an unfurnished and dreary chamber, many a defaced
cornice and broken pane, at variance with the notions
of comfort and neatness entertained by the vicar’s wife.</p>

<p>Ida and Mabel, who had more poetry in their
nature than had fallen to the lot of Mrs. Aumerle,
and who delighted in whatever recalled to their
minds grand images of the days of chivalry, saw in
the marks of dilapidation but the footprints of ages
gone by, and in imagination peopled the grass-grown
court and the mouldering battlements with mailed
knights, bold archers, and the fair maidens whose
charms had been sung by minstrel and bard in the
time of the old Plantagenets.</p>

<p>“That little grey dot yonder, is it not—” Mabel
began, and paused, for Cecilia, whom she was addressing,
looked as if she did not wish to see it.</p>

<p>“Yes, that is Mill Cottage,” said the doctor in
a tone more loud and decided even than usual;
“the place where the master of Nettleby Tower dug
out his own potatoes in his garden, and the lady—”</p>

<p>“And that must be Dashleigh Hall,” interrupted
Mabel, wishing to effect a diversion, for it was evident
that while the doctor’s pride made him rather glory
in his late poverty, that of Miss Bardon rendered
her desirous to forget the days of her humiliation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>But Mabel’s diversion was very ill-chosen. At
the mention of the name “Dashleigh,” the doctor’s
countenance, which had been wearing an expression
far more complacent than that habitual to his leonine
features, changed to one dark and louring, the index
of the gloomy passions that reigned within. Mabel
saw not the change, for her eyes were fixed upon
the distant prospect, but it was witnessed by Augustine
and Ida, who exchanged glances with each
other,—the gentle girl’s significant of regret, the
uncle’s of indignation. “Is not the black drop wrung
out from that proud heart yet?” was the mental
comment of Augustine.</p>

<p>“Has not this house the repute of being haunted?”
asked Ida, in order to turn the doctor’s thoughts
into a different channel.</p>

<p>“Old women and young fools say that it is so
still,” replied Timon Bardon gruffly.</p>

<p>“O! Papa,” lisped Cecilia, who had no inclination
to acknowledge herself as coming under either
of these denominations, “you know what strange
noises are heard every night!”</p>

<p>“Creaking of doors, cracking of old timber, the
wind whistling away in the chimneys!”</p>

<p>“Well, I confess,” said Cecilia, with a little
affected laugh, “that delightful as the tower is on a
summer’s day like this, I shall not care to wander
much through its long echoing corridors on a dark
winter’s night. Mr. Aumerle,” she continued, addressing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
Augustine, who was leaning on the stone
parapet, and gazing down with an abstracted air,
“you who know everything, do you know of no
charm to lay the bad spirits that are said to haunt
ancient houses?”</p>

<p>“I am afraid,” replied Augustine gravely, “that
such spirits are wont to haunt new houses as well
as old ones, and that it needs more knowledge than
philosophy can teach to give us the power to lay
them.”</p>

<p>Cecilia looked puzzled at the enigmatical reply,
but before she had time to ask for a solution, Mabel
interrupted the conversation by suddenly exclaiming,
“Surely that is the Dashleigh’s carriage that has
just turned the corner of the hill!”</p>

<p>“We have stayed long enough on this tower,” said
the doctor, averting his eyes from the direction in
which those of Mabel were turned; “let us descend
to the court.”</p>

<p>His suggestion, which sounded like a command,
was followed at once by his guests; poor Cecilia
heaved a sigh at the thought that once she might
have indulged a hope that the gay carriage with its
dashing bays might be bound for Nettleby Tower.
“After all that has happened,” she reflected sadly,
“that is impossible now!”</p>

<p>The descent of the long winding stairs, whose
steep, rude, age-worn steps were only dimly lighted
by narrow slits cut here and there in the massive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
stone wall, required both caution and time. Ere
Bardon, who was the last of the party, had emerged
from the low-browed door which opened into the
courtyard, the bridge across the moat had been
crossed, and the Earl and Countess of Dashleigh
were already exchanging kindly greetings with the
foremost of the Aumerles.</p>

<p>The stern old doctor was more startled by the
unexpected appearance at his threshold of visitors
such as these, than he could have been by any apparition
in his old haunted tower. Mingled feelings
of surprise, shame, remorse, and gratified pride
struggled together in his bosom, as his eye met that
of the nobleman from whose house he had turned
with emotions of such vindictive wrath—words of
such fiery passion! Had Bardon’s newly recovered
estate depended upon his making such an effort, the
proud man could not have bowed his spirit to the
humiliation of visiting the earl; and yet the nobleman
had come to him,—to him who had so meanly,
so cruelly avenged one slighting sentence accidentally
overheard!</p>

<p>Dashleigh saw the surprise, the embarrassment
written on the face of the haughty Bardon,—he felt
the delicacy of his own position, and resolutely
breaking through what would once have been the
inseparable barrier of reserve, he advanced two or
three steps towards the doctor, and while a painful
flush mantled over his wasted features, frankly held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
out his hand. That hand was grasped—was wrung—but
in silence; the proud man felt himself conquered;
and from that hour the evil spirit of enmity
between the two opponents was laid for ever!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Can I add that the dark tyrant Pride had for
ever yielded up his empire, that he never again
whispered his evil suggestions to those who so long
had worn his chain?</p>

<p>Alas! I dare not thus violate probability, or sacrifice
the great truth of which this fiction is the
fanciful vehicle. The contest against Pride is a
life-long campaign. From the time when he breathed
ambition to Eve in the words, <em>Ye shall be as gods</em>, or
roused in the heart of the first murderer the hatred
which stained his hand with the blood of a more
favoured brother, the influence of pride over our
fallen race has been fearful, too often fatal! I have
but sketched him in some of his forms,—of how
many have I not even attempted to trace the outline!
Pride of purse, Pride of person, family Pride,
national Pride, the Pride that draws the trigger of
the duellist, that tightens the grasp of the oppressor,
and, perhaps worst of all, spiritual Pride, which
brings Satan before even the saintly in the guise of
an angel of light! Let some more powerful pencil
draw these, till conscience start at the portrait of
the demon who seeks the house that is <em>cleansed and
garnished</em>, nor comes alone, but brings with him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
ambition, dissension, jealousy, hatred, and other dark
ministers of death.</p>

<p>Reader! have you recognised Pride as an evil,
have you struggled with him as a foe? Look to
your soul and see if it bear not the mark of his
galling chain. If the fetter be on it still, oh! with
the strength of faith and the energy of prayer, burst
it, even as Samson burst the green withes with
which a secret enemy had bound him! Or, to
change the metaphor, if you feel the proud spirit
within, like the inflated sphere of the æronaut, ready
to bear you aloft to a cloudy and perilous height,
whence you will look down on your fellow-creatures,
stop not to dally with danger, persuade not yourself
that the peril is unreal, but resolute as one who
knows that life and more than life is at stake, clip
the soaring wing of the <i>Eaglet</i>,—cut the cords of
your balloon!</p>

<div class="verse">To strew with flowers the path which sinners tread,</div>
<div class="verse">To hide one treacherous snare by Satan spread,</div>
<div class="verse">How blest—how great compared to thee—that man</div>
<div class="verse">Whose life obscurely ends as it began.</div>
<div class="verse">To whose meek soul no knowledge e’er was given,</div>

<div class="verse">Far as the sun’s pure radiance, streaming bright,</div>
<div class="verse">Transcends the glow-worm’s dim and fading light,</div>
<div class="verse">The wisdom to his soul vouchsafed from high</div>
<div class="verse">Exceeds the earth-born fires that flash—and die!</div>

<div class="verse">Who, with God’s presence blest, desires no more,</div>

<div class="verse">Wisest of men—for he alone is wise.—</div>
<div class="verse">Richest of men—secure his treasure lies.—</div>
<div class="verse">Greatest of men—his mansion is on high.</div>
<div class="verse">His father—God,—his rest—Eternity!</div>
